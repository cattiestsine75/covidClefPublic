unclear.\n\n This study investigated 14 respiratory viruses in ARIs among children and associated meteorological factors in Shantou, southern China.\n\n\nMethods\nPaired nasal/throat-flocked swabs collected from 1,074 children with ARIs, who visited outpatient walk-in clinics in a tertiary hospital between December 2010 and November 2011, were examined for fourteen respiratory viruses - influenza viruses (FluA, FluB), respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV A and B), human coronaviruses (hCoV: 229E, OC43, HKU1, NL63), human metapneumoviruses (hMPV A and B), parainfluenza viruses (PIV1-4), human rhinoviruses (HRV A, B, C), enteroviruses (EV), adenoviruses (ADV), human bocavirus (hBoV), and human parechoviruses (hPeV) - by multiplex real-time PCR.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified at least one virus in 82.3% (884/1,074) and multiple viruses in 38.6% (415/1,074) of patients.\n\n EV and HRV were the most frequently detected single viruses (42.3%, 374/884 and 39.9%, 353/884 respectively) and co-detected pair (23.1%, 96/415).\n\n Overlapping seasonal trends of viruses were recorded over the year, with dual peaks for EV and single peaks for the others.\n\n By logistic regression analysis, EV was positively associated with the average temperature and humidity, hCoV, and PIV4, but negatively with HRV, PIV3, and hBoV.\n\n HRV was inversely associated with EV and PIV3.\nConclusions\nThis study reports high viral detection and co-detection rates in pediatric ARI cases mainly due to EV and HRV.\n\n Many viruses circulated throughout the year with similar seasonal trends in association with temperature, humidity, and wind velocity.\n\n Statistically significant associations were present among the viruses.\n\n Understanding the polyviral etiology and viral interactions in the cases with multiple viruses warrants further studies.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12879-015-0863-6) contains supplementary material, which is

outpatient visits of acute upper respiratory infections for children aged less than 15 years are associated with temperature, air pollutants and circulating respiratory viruses in Taipei, Taiwan, from 2003 to 2007.\nMethods\nOutpatient records for acute upper respiratory infections (ICD9 CM codes: 460, 462, 463,464, 465.9 and 487) in a randomly selected sample (n=39,766 children in 2005) was used to estimate the cumulative relative risks (RR) associated with average temperature lasting for 8 days (lag 0–7 days), air pollutants (NO2, O3 and PM2.5) lasting for 6 days (lag 0–5 days), and virus-specific positive isolation rate lasting for 11 days (lag 0–10 days) using distributed lag non-linear models after controlling for relative humidity, wind speed, day of week, holiday effects and long-term trend.\n\n\nResults\nAverage temperature of 33 °C was associated with the lowest risk for outpatient visits of acute upper respiratory infections.\n\n Relative to 33 °C, cumulative 8-day RR was highest at 15 °C of ambient average temperature [RR=1.94; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.78, 2.11].\n\n With the first quartile as reference, cumulative 6-day RRs were 1.25 (95% CI: 1.21, 1.29)

children is still unclear.\n To simultaneously detect viruses that are involved in the aetiology of respiratory infections, we used a DNA/RNA microarray assay that identifies 17 different viruses or viral subtypes.\n Rhinopharyngeal washes were taken from 611 children (aged 1?month to 14?years) who presented in the emergency department with respiratory infections from June 2010 to June 2011 and were treated as outpatients (299, 48.9%) or hospitalized (312, 51.1%).\n Lower respiratory tract infection was diagnosed more often in hospitalized children (68% versus 36%, p?0.001).\n Of 397 children in which microarrays detected viral infection (70.1%), a single virus was found in 228 (57.4%) and two or more viruses in 169 (42.5%).\n The most prevalent viruses among children with positive samples were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 225 (56.6%), parainfluenza virus (PIV) in 118 (29.7%), rhinovirus (RV) in 73 (18.4%), followed by influenza in 56 (14.1%), adenoviruses in 31 (7.8%), bocavirus in 25 (6.3%), human metapneumovirus in 15 (3.7%) and enteroviruses in 12 (3%).\n Most common viral co?infections were RSVA–RSVB in 46 children (27.2%), RSV–Influenza in 20 (11.8%), RSV–RV in 18 (10.6%) and PIV–RV in 13 (7.7%).\n Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that viral co?infections were associated with increased probability for hospitalization (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.01–2.29, p?0.04), and previous pneumococcal vaccination was associated with decreased probability for hospitalization (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33–0.81, p?0.004).\n We conclude that viral co?infections are

Madagascar, July 2008 to June 2009","abstract":"Background\nIn Madagascar, despite an influenza surveillance established since 1978, little is known about the etiology and prevalence of viruses other than influenza causing influenza-like illnesses (ILIs).\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nFrom July 2008 to June 2009, we collected respiratory specimens from patients who presented ILIs symptoms in public and private clinics in Antananarivo (the capital city of Madagascar).\n\n ILIs were defined as body temperature ?38°C and cough and at least two of the following symptoms: sore throat, rhinorrhea, headache and muscular pain, for a maximum duration of 3 days.\n\n We screened these specimens using five multiplex real time Reverse Transcription and/or Polymerase Chain Reaction assays for detection of 14 respiratory viruses.\n\n We detected respiratory viruses in 235/313 (75.1%) samples.\n\n Overall influenza virus A (27.3%) was the most common virus followed by rhinovirus (24.8%), RSV (21.2%), adenovirus (6.1%), coronavirus OC43 (6.1%), influenza virus B (3.9%), parainfluenza virus-3 (2.9%), and parainfluenza virus-1 (2.3%).\n\n Co-infections occurred in 29.4% (69/235) of infected patients and rhinovirus was the most detected virus (27.5%).\n\n Children under 5 years were more likely to have one or more detectable virus associated with their ILI.\n\n In this age group, compared to those ?5 years, the risk of detecting more than one virus was higher (OR?=?1.9), as was the risk of detecting of RSV (OR?=?10.1) and adenovirus (OR?=?4.7).\n\n While rhinovirus and adenovirus infections occurred year round, RSV, influenza virus A and coronavirus OC43 had defined period of circulation.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn our study, we found that respiratory viruses play an important role in ILIs in the Malagasy community, particularly in children under 5 years old.\n\n These data provide a better understanding of the viral etiology of outpatients with ILI and describe for the first time importance of these viruses in different age group and their period of circulation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3048401","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Norosoa

collected among the children with acute respiratory tract infections in outpatient department from September 2006 to August 2008. The samples were analyzed by PCR and the sequences were blasted with the sequences of Adv in GenBank.\n Clinical data were analyzed along with virological data by using appropriate statistical methods.\n Adv was detected in 25 out of 512 (4.9%) children.\n The genome types of 23 samples were determined after analysis of the gene sequence.\n The most prevalent Adv type was species B type 3. Among the patients, 10 were of Ad3 (43.5%), three were of Ad1 (1.3%), five were of species C Ad2 (21.7%), and five were of species E Ad4 (21.7%).\n A higher incidence of positive results was found during the summer season, thus showing a pattern of seasonality.\n There exists Adv infection in children with acute respiratory system diseases in Guangzhou area.\n No significant differences were

(HRV), have repeatedly been detected in acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in children in the past decades.\n However, in the last ten years thanks to progress in molecular technologies, newly discovered viruses have been identified including human Metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronaviruses NL63 (HcoV-NL63) and HKU1 (HcoV-HKU1), human Bocavirus (HBoV), new enterovirus (HEV), parechovirus (HpeV) and rhinovirus (HRV) strains, polyomaviruses WU (WUPyV) and KI (KIPyV) and the pandemic H1N1v influenza A virus.\n These discoveries have heavily modified previous knowledge on respiratory infections mainly highlighting that pediatric population is exposed to a variety of viruses with similar seasonal patterns.\n In this context establishing a causal link between a newly identified virus and the disease as well as an association between mixed infections and an increase in disease severity can be challenging.\n This review will present an overview of newly recognized as well as

predicted to encode small T antigen, large T antigen, and three capsid proteins: VP1, VP2, and VP3. Phylogenetic analysis clearly revealed that the WU virus was divergent from all known polyomaviruses.\n Screening of 2,135 patients with acute respiratory tract infections in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, and St.\n Louis, Missouri, United States, using WU virus–specific PCR primers resulted in the detection of 43 additional specimens that contained WU virus.\n The presence of multiple

disease (ARD) hospitalized in a pediatric department in northern Italy was carried out to evaluate the role as respiratory pathogens or co?pathogens of recently identified viruses.\n The presence of respiratory syncitial virus (RSV), human Metapneumoviruses (hMPVs), human Bocaviruses (hBoVs), and human Coronaviruses (hCoVs) was assayed by molecular detection and clinical symptoms evaluated.\n Nasopharyngeal aspirates from 150 of the 322 infants (46.6%) tested positive for at least one pathogen.\n Ninety samples (28.0%) tested positive for RSV RNA (61.5% genotype A and 38.5% genotype B), 46 (14.3%) for hMPV RNA (71.7% subtype A and 28.3% subtype B), 28 (8.7%) for hCoV RNA (39.3% hCoV?OC43, 35.7% hCoV?NL63, 21.4% hCoV?HKU1, and 3.6% hCoV?229E), and 7 (2.2%) for hBoV DNA (of the 6 typed, 50% subtype 1 and 50% subtype 2); 21/150 samples revealed the presence of 2 or more viruses.\n Co?infection rates were higher for hMPVs, hCoVs, and hBoV (38.3%, 46.4%, and 57.1%,) and lower for RSV (23.3%).\n RSV was associated with the presence of complications (P?&lt;?0.001) and hypoxia (P?&lt;?0.015).\n When the presence of RSV alone and the RSV?hMPV co?infections were considered, RSV mono?infected patients resulted to have longer hospitalization and higher hypoxia (P?&lt;?0.001).\n The data highlight that (i) RSV has a central role as a respiratory pathogen of infants, (ii) the wide circulation of recently identified viruses does not reduce the clinical and epidemiological importance of RSV, and that (iii) recently identified agents (hMPVs, hBoVs, and hCoVs) act as primary

infections is not clear.\n\n\nObjective\nTo evaluate the correlation of viral load as well as viral and bacterial co-infections with disease severity in hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs).\n\n\nStudy design\nThis is a prospective study conducted in children admitted for LRTIs for two seasons.\n\n To determine viral and bacterial load of respiratory pathogens we performed multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction and semiquantitative bacterial cultures on nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA).\n\n\nResults\nDuring the study period 244 (60%) children were hospitalized for LRTI with acute virus-induced wheezing and 160 (40%) for radiologic confirmed pneumonia.\n\n In the first NPA, viruses were identified in 315 (78%) of the 404 samples and bacteria in 198 (63.3%) of 311 samples.\n\n The viral load significantly decreased between the first and second NPA sample in most single and viral co-infections, except rhinovirus and human bocavirus infections.\n\n Viral load was inversely related to CRP in RSV infections, whereas a positive correlation was observed in adenovirus infections.\n\n Duration of hospitalization was significantly longer in RSV single infections compared to rhinovirus single infections whereas in the latter, leucocytosis and use of systemic steroids was more common.\n\n In RSV viral co-infections the presence

Novel Bocavirus Associated with Acute Gastroenteritis in Australian Children","abstract":"Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a common illness affecting all age groups worldwide, causing an estimated three million deaths annually.\n Viruses such as rotavirus, adenovirus, and caliciviruses are a major cause of AGE, but in many patients a causal agent cannot be found despite extensive diagnostic testing.\n Proposing that novel viruses are the reason for this diagnostic gap, we used molecular screening to investigate a cluster of undiagnosed cases that were part of a larger case control study into the etiology of pediatric AGE.\n Degenerate oligonucleotide primed (DOP) PCR was used to non-specifically amplify viral DNA from fecal specimens.\n The amplified DNA was then cloned and sequenced for analysis.\n A novel virus was detected.\n Elucidation and analysis of the genome indicates it is a member of the Bocavirus genus of the Parvovirinae, 23% variant at the nucleotide level from its closest formally recognized relative, the Human Bocavirus (HBoV), and similar to the very recently proposed second species of Bocavirus (HBoV2).\n Fecal samples collected from case control pairs during 2001 for the AGE study were tested with a bocavirus-specific PCR, and HBoV2 (sequence confirmed) was detected in 32 of 186 cases with AGE (prevalence 17.2%) compared with only 15 controls (8.1%).\n In this same group of children, HBoV2 prevalence was exceeded only by rotavirus (39.2%) and astrovirus (21.5%) and was more prevalent than norovirus genogroup 2 (13.4%) and adenovirus (4.8%).\n In a univariate analysis of the matched pairs (McNemar's Test), the odds ratio for the association of AGE with HBoV2 infection was 2.6 (95% confidence interval 1.2–5.7); P?=?0.007. During the course of this screening, a second novel bocavirus was detected which we have designated HBoV species 3 (HBoV3).\n The prevalence of HBoV3 was low (2.7%), and it was not associated with AGE.\n HBoV2 and HBoV3 are newly discovered bocaviruses, of which HBoV2 is the thirdmost-prevalent virus, after rotavirus and astrovirus, associated with pediatric AGE in this

viruses found in the respiratory tract because of the high total number of HRV infections occurring throughout the year.\n\n This feature has previously relegated HRVs to being considered passengers in acute respiratory infections.\n\n HRVs remain poorly characterized and are seldom included as a target in diagnostic panels despite their pathogenic potential, infection-associated healthcare

respiratory illness in Nicaragua in September 2010. The aim of this study, was to retrospectively examine the presence and the role of EV109 in respiratory samples from two patients populations; infants below the age of 2?years, hospitalized for acute

reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR).\n\n In positive samples, the presence of the most common respiratory viruses was also assayed and clinical symptoms were evaluated.\n\n Samples from 2 of the 974 infants tested positive for EV109 RNA (0.2%) and belonged to patients with lower ARDs; co-infection with other viral pathogens under study was observed in both cases.\n\n In transplant recipients, one out of the 175 samples analyzed, from a patients with upper respiratory simptoms tested positive for HEV 109 in the absence of co-infecting viruses.\n\n Sequence analysis of amplified EV109 genomic

the Early Weeks of H1N1v Epidemic in France","abstract":"Background\nInfluenza-like illness (ILI) may be caused by a variety of pathogens.\n\n Clinical observations are of little help to recognise myxovirus infection and implement appropriate prevention measures.\n\n The limited use of molecular tools underestimates the role of other common pathogens.\n\n\nObjectives\nDuring the early weeks of the 2009–2010 flu pandemic, a clinical and virological survey was conducted in adult and paediatric patients with ILI referred to two French University hospitals in Paris and Tours.\n\n Aims were to investigate the different pathogens involved in ILI and describe the associated symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nH1N1v pandemic influenza diagnosis was performed with real time RT-PCR assay.\n\n Other viral aetiologies were investigated by the molecular multiplex assay RespiFinder19®.\n\n Clinical data were collected prospectively by physicians using a standard questionnaire.\n\n\nResults\nFrom week 35 to 44, endonasal swabs were collected in 413 patients.\n\n Overall, 68 samples (16.5%) were positive for H1N1v.\n\n In 13 of them, other respiratory pathogens were also detected.\n\n Among H1N1v negative samples, 213 (61.9%) were positive for various respiratory agents, 190 in single infections and 23 in mixed infections.\n\n The most prevalent viruses in H1N1v negative single infections were rhinovirus (62.6%), followed by parainfluenza viruses (24.2%) and adenovirus (5.3%).\n\n 70.6% of H1N1v cases were identified in patients under 40 years and none after 65 years.\n\n There was no difference between clinical symptoms observed in patients infected with H1N1v or with other pathogens.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur results highlight the high frequency of non-influenza viruses involved in ILI during the pre-epidemic period of a flu alert and the lack of specific clinical signs associated with influenza infections.\n\n Rapid diagnostic screening of a large panel of respiratory pathogens may be critical to define and survey the epidemic situation and to provide critical information for patient management.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3157400","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nathalie","surname":"Schnepf","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Matthieu","surname":"Resche-Rigon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Antoine","surname":"Chaillon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anne","surname":"Scemla","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guillaume","surname":"Gras","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Oren","surname":"Semoun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pierre","surname":"Taboulet","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean-Michel","surname":"Molina","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"François","surname":"Simon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alain","surname":"Goudeau","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jérôme","surname":"LeGoff","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Baochuan","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Baochuan","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JCM.00733-10","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Rapid

with Acute Bronchiolitis","abstract":"OBJECTIVES:\nTo determine the viruses and risk factors associated with hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in infants with acute bronchiolitis.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION:\nBronchiolitis is a major cause of morbidity in infants.\n\n Widespread use of molecular-based methods has yielded new insights about its etiology, but the impact of viral etiologies on early outcomes is still unclear.\n\n\nMETHODS:\nSeventy-seven infants with bronchiolitis who were under two years of age and visited an emergency unit were included.\n\n Using molecular-based methods, samples were tested for 12 different respiratory viruses.\n\n Logistic regression models were used to identify clinical and virological variables associated with the main endpoints: hospital admission and ICU admission.\n\n\nRESULTS:\nWe identified at least one virus in 93.5% of patients, and coinfections were found in nearly 40% of patients.\n\n RSV was the most common pathogen (63.6%), followed by rhinovirus (39%).\n\n Identification of RSV was only associated with an increased risk of hospital admission in the univariate model.\n\n Younger age and enterovirus infection were associated with an increased risk of hospital admission, while atopy of a first-degree relative showed a protective effect.\n\n Prematurity was associated with an increased risk of admission to the ICU.\n\n Coinfections were not associated with worse outcomes.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nMolecular-based methods resulted in high rates of viral identification but did not change the significant role of RSV in acute bronchiolitis.\n\n Younger age and enterovirus infection were risk factors for hospital admission, while prematurity appeared to be a significant risk factor for admission to the ICU in acute viral bronchiolitis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2999709","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Milena

lacking.\n Between November 2004 and October 2006, the presence of 14 respiratory viruses in children aged less than 3 years old with community?acquired pneumonia were investigated using molecular or immunochromatographic techniques and/or viral culture.\n A total of 315 children (338 episodes) were included, and hospitalization was required in 178 episodes.\n At least one virus was detected in 66.9% of the episodes and simultaneous detection of two or more viruses was frequent (27% of the episodes with viral detection).\n The most frequently detected virus was respiratory syncytial virus (n?=?67: 33 subgroup A, 33 subgroup B, 1 not typed), followed by human bocavirus (n?=?48), rhinovirus (n?=?46), human metapneumovirus (n?=?39: 13 genotype A2, 8 B1, 5 B2, 1 A1, 12 not genotyped) and parainfluenza viruses (n?=?38: 1 type 1, 3 type 2, 22 type 3, 11 type 4 and 1 not typed).\n The 14 viruses investigated were found in viral coinfections, which were more frequent in children aged less than 12 months.\n Except for adenovirus, the incidence of which was low, the percentage of viral coinfection ranged between 28.2% and 68.8%.\n Children with viral coinfection more frequently required hospital admission than those with single viral infection.\n It is concluded that viral coinfections are frequent in children aged less than 3 years old with community?acquired pneumonia and can be a poor prognostic factor.\n J.\n Med.\n Virol.\n 80:1843–1849, 2008. © 2008 Wiley?Liss,

y of age with LRTIs were analysed by a quantitative HCoV-NL63-specific real-time PCR.\n\n The samples had been collected from hospitalised patients and outpatients from December 1999 to October 2001 in four different regions in Germany as part of the prospective population-based PRI.\n\nDE study and analysed for RNA from respiratory viruses.\n\n Forty-nine samples (5.2%), mainly derived from the winter season, were positive for HCoV-NL63 RNA.\n\n The viral RNA was more prevalent in samples from outpatients (7.9%) than from hospitalised patients (3.2%, p = 0.003), and co-infection with either respiratory syncytial virus or parainfluenza virus 3 was observed frequently.\n\n Samples in which only HCoV-NL63 RNA could be detected had a significantly higher viral load than samples containing additional respiratory viruses (median 2.1 × 106 versus 2.7 × 102 copies/ml, p = 0.0006).\n\n A strong association with croup was apparent: 43% of the HCoV-NL63-positive patients with high HCoV-NL63

including respiratory syncytial virus; adenovirus; influenza virus (Flu) types A and B; parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1, 2, and 3; chlamydia pneumonia; and mycoplasma pneumonia.\n\n A medical history of each child was taken.\n\n\nResults\nRespiratory agents were detected in 164 (51.9%) of 316 children with ARTI.\n\n A single agent was identified in 50 (15.8%) children, and multiple agents

from November 2010 to October 2011 of outpatients with influenza?like illness in Nanjing, China.\n The two largest general hospitals and a provincial virus laboratory in Nanjing participated in this study.\n Throat swabs were collected from outpatients during medical visits for influenza?like illness and were tested for 16 respiratory viruses using PCR.\n Three hundred seventeen viruses were detected in samples from 246 (50.6%) patients with influenza?like illness.\n The viruses found mostly commonly were influenza, rhinovirus, hCoV HKU1, and adenovirus.\n The identification rates of respiratory viruses differed significantly among different sampling seasons (P?=?0.0002).\n The rates of influenza A and hCoV HKU1 were much higher during the influenza?like illness winter peak than during the influenza?like illness summer peak and other months.\n Co?infections were detected in 57 (11.7%) patients and were found most commonly in adults older than 60 years.\n RSV was detected in 5.9% and 2.6% of patients who were 0–5 and 6–15 years old, respectively, but was not detected in other age groups.\n This study confirmed that multiple respiratory viruses may circulate concurrently

major cause of morbidity and mortality in young children worldwide.\n\n Information on viral etiology in ALRI from India is limited.\n\n The aim of the present study was to develop a simple, sensitive, specific and cost effective multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay without post PCR hybridization or nested PCR steps for the detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses (PIV1–3) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV).\n\n Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected from children with ALRI ? 5 years of age.\n\n The sensitivity and specificity of mPCR was compared to virus isolation by centrifugation enhanced culture (CEC) followed by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF).\n\n\nResults\nFrom April 2005–March 2007, 301 NPAs were collected from children attending the outpatient department or admitted to the ward of All India Institute of Medical Sciences hospital at New Delhi, India.\n\n Multiplex PCR detected respiratory viruses in 106 (35.2%) of 301 samples with 130 viruses of which RSV was detected in 61, PIV3 in 22, PIV2 in 17, hMPV in 11, PIV1 in 10 and influenza A in 9 children.\n\n CEC-IIF detected 79 viruses only.\n\n The sensitivity of mPCR was 0.1TCID50 for RSV and influenza A and 1TCID50 for hMPV, PIV1, PIV2, PIV3 and Influenza B.\n\n Mixed infections were detected in 18.8% of the children with viral infections, none detected by CEC-IIF.\n\n Bronchiolitis was significantly associated with both total viral infections and RSV infection (p &lt; 0.05).\n\n History of ARI in family predisposed children to acquire viral infection (p &gt; 0.05).\n\n\nConclusion\nMultiplex PCR offers a rapid, sensitive and reasonably priced diagnostic method for common respiratory viruses.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2709894","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Preeti","surname":"Bharaj","email":"preetibharaj@yahoo.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wayne

by two multiplex reverse transcription nested?PCR assays","abstract":"There is a need for rapid, sensitive, and accurate diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections in children, elderly, and immunocompromised patients, who are susceptible to serious complications.\n The multiplex RT?nested PCR assay has been used widely for simultaneous detection of non?related viruses involved in infectious diseases because of its high specificity and sensitivity.\n A new multiplex RT?PCR assay is described in this report.\n This approach includes nested primer sets targeted to conserve regions of human parainfluenza virus haemagglutinin, human coronavirus spike protein, and human enterovirus and rhinovirus polyprotein genes.\n It permits rapid, sensitive, and simultaneous detection and typing of the four types of parainfluenza viruses (1, 2, 3, 4AB), human coronavirus 229E and OC43, and the generic detection of enteroviruses and rhinoviruses.\n The testing of 201 clinical specimens with this multiplex assay along with other one formerly described by our group to simultaneously detect and type the influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, and a generic detection of all serotypes of adenovirus, covers the detection of most viruses causing respiratory infectious disease in humans.\n The results obtained were compared with conventional viral culture, immunofluorescence assay, and a third multiplex RT?PCR assay for all human parainfluenza viruses types described previously.\n In conclusion, both multiplex RT?PCR assays provide a system capable of detecting and identifying simultaneously 14 different respiratory viruses in clinical specimens with high sensitivity and specificity, being useful for routine diagnosis and survey of these viruses within the population.\n J.\n Med.\n Virol.\n 72:484–495, 2004. © 2004 Wiley?Liss,

of age.\n\n There is a need to better describe the epidemiology of viral community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in developing countries.\n\n\nMethods\nFrom July 2004 to June 2007, we examined nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from 2,230 cases of pneumonia (World Health Organization criteria) in children 2 to 35 months old recruited in a randomized trial of zinc supplementation at a field clinic in Bhaktapur, Nepal.\n\n The specimens were examined for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus type A (InfA) and B (InfB), parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3 (PIV1, PIV2, and PIV3), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) using a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 919 virus isolates in 887 (40.0%) of the 2,219 NPA specimens with a valid PCR result, of which 334 (15.1%) yielded RSV, 164 (7.4%) InfA, 129 (5.8%) PIV3, 98 (4.4%) PIV1, 93 (4.2%) hMPV, 84 (3.8%) InfB, and 17 (0.8%) PIV2. CAP occurred in an epidemic pattern with substantial temporal variation during the three years of study.\n\n The largest peaks of pneumonia occurrence coincided with peaks of RSV infection, which occurred in epidemics during the rainy season and in winter.\n\n The monthly number of RSV infections was positively correlated with relative humidity (rs = 0.40, P = 0.01), but not with temperature or rainfall.\n\n An hMPV epidemic occurred during one of the three winter seasons and the monthly number of hMPV cases was also associated with relative humidity (rs = 0.55, P = 0.0005).\n\n\nConclusion\nRespiratory RNA viruses were detected from NPA in 40% of CAP cases in our study.\n\n The most commonly isolated viruses were RSV, InfA, and PIV3. RSV infections contributed substantially to the observed CAP epidemics.\n\n The occurrence of viral CAP in this community seemed to reflect more or less overlapping micro-epidemics with several respiratory viruses, highlighting the challenges of developing and implementing effective public health control measures.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2727531","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria","surname":"Mathisen","email":"maria.mathisen@cih.uib.no","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tor A","surname":"Strand","email":"tor.strand@cih.uib.no","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Biswa N","surname":"Sharma","email":"biswasharma@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ram K","surname":"Chandyo","email":"ram.chandyo@cih.uib.no","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Palle","surname":"Valentiner-Branth","email":"PVB@ssi.dk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sudha","surname":"Basnet","email":"sudhacbasnet@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ramesh K","surname":"Adhikari","email":"ramesh@healthnet.org.np","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dag","surname":"Hvidsten","email":"Dag.Hvidsten@unn.no","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Prakash S","surname":"Shrestha","email":"shresthaps@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Halvor","surname":"Sommerfelt","email":"halvor.sommerfelt@cih.uib.no","contributions":"1"}],"References":[{"doi":"10.1046/j.1365-3156.1998.00213.x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Respiratory syncytial virus infection in tropical and developing countries","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S1045-1870(98)80035-6","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Viral pneumonia in children","abstract":"Viral pneumonia causes a heavy burden on our society.\n In the United States, more than one million cases of pneumonias afflict children under the age of 5 years, costing hundreds of millions of dollars annually.\n The majority of these infections are caused by a handful of common viruses.\n Knowledge of the epidemiology of these viruses combined with new rapid diagnostic techniques will provide faster and more, reliable diagnoses in the future.\n Although the basic clinical epidemiology of these viruses has been carefully investigated over the last 30 years, new molecular techniques are greatly expanding our understanding of these agents and the diseases they cause.\n Antigenic and genetic variations are being discovered in many viruses previously thought to be homogeneous.\n The exact roles and the biological significance of these variations are just beginning to be explored, but already evidence of differences in pathogenicity and immunogenicity has been found in many of these substrains.\n All of this information clearly will impact the development of future vaccines and antiviral drugs.\n Effective drugs exist for prophylaxis against influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus, and specific therapy exists for influenza A.\n Ribarivin is approved for use in respiratory synctial virus infections, and it alone or in combination with other agents (eg, IGIV) may be effective in immunocompromised patients, either in preventing the development of pneumonia or in decreasing morbidity and mortality.\n Many new antiviral agents are being tested and developed, and several are in clinical trials.\n","id":"PMC7129604","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kelly J.","surname":"Henrickson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiology of acute respiratory infections in children of developing countries","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1542/peds.113.6.1758","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Population-based surveillance for hospitalizations associated with respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza viruses among young children","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"National disease burden of respiratory viruses detected in children by polymerase chain reaction","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The epidemiology of acute respiratory tract infection in young children: comparison of findings from several developing countries.

uncharacterized.\n We employed 17 PCR assays and retrospectively screened 315 specimens selected by season from a predominantly pediatric hospital?based population.\n Before the Brisbane respiratory virus research study commenced, one or more predominantly viral pathogens had been detected in 15.2% (n?=?48) of all specimens.\n The Brisbane study made an additional 206 viral detections, resulting in the identification of a microbe in 67.0% of specimens.\n After our study, the majority of microbes detected were RNA viruses (89.9%).\n Overall, human rhinoviruses (HRVs) were the most frequently identified target (n?=?140) followed by human adenoviruses (HAdVs; n?=?25), human metapneumovirus (HMPV; n?=?18), human bocavirus (HBoV; n?=?15), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV; n?=?12), human coronaviruses (HCoVs; n?=?11), and human herpesvirus?6 (n?=?11).\n HRVs were the sole microbe detected in 37.8% (n?=?31) of patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI).\n Genotyping of the HRV VP4/VP2 region resulted in a proposed subdivision of HRV type A into sublineages A1 and A2.

of viruses in respiratory tract specimens.\n In the present study, the application of a multiplex RT?PCR DNA microarray in diagnosis and epidemiological survey of viral infections in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis was assessed.\n One hundred and thirty?eight nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from October 2007 to September 2008 were tested by direct immunofluorescence and viral culture, a combination of referenced RT?PCRs and the DNA microarray.\n One or more viruses were detected in 96, 126 and 126 of the specimens by direct immunofluorescence and viral culture, RT?PCRs and DNA microarray, respectively (70 vs.\n 91 vs.\n 91%, P?&lt;?10?3).\n The RT?PCRs and the DNA microarray yielded concordant results for 99% of specimens and identified mixed viral infections in 85 (62%).\n The most common associations were: human bocavirus and respiratory syncytial virus (32%), adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (30%), and parainfluenza virus type 3 and respiratory syncytial virus (23%).\n None of the bronchiolitis severity parameters including intensive care unit admission, O2 supply, O2 saturation percentage, O2 length and length of stay at the hospital appeared to be significantly increased in multiple viral infections compared to single viral infections (P?&gt;?0.1).\n In conclusion, the use of this DNA microarray in clinical virology practice allows rapid and accurate identification of common and uncommon viral respiratory pathogens in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis.\n It should improve the clinical management, the epidemiological

recently even only for A(H1N1)2009 virus.\n However, in a substantial number of patients with a respiratory tract disease, co-infection with various viral pathogens has been confirmed.\n Although the association between the occurrence of co-infection and substantially higher severity of disease is still unclear, a rapid and proper diagnostics of wide spectrum of viral respiratory pathogens reveals an accurate picture of the disease and is essential for appropriate therapeutic management and control of infection.\n In the present study we reported five cases of multiple respiratory infection in hospitalized immunosuppressed patients: two double infections with influenza virus (IV) type A/respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) type A and IV type A/coronavirus (CoV) OC43, one infection with four viruses – IV type A/RSV type A and B/CoV OC43, and two cases of mixed infections caused by five viral agents – IV type A and B/RSV type A and B/ parainfluenza type 3 or CoV OC43. Each patient had an underlying chronic disease and received immunosuppressive treatment.\n Despite a low number of tested specimens, our study shows that the inclusions of multiplex PCR methods for diagnostics of respiratory tract infections and the extension of diagnostic strategies by clinicians to detect viruses other than influenza are very important and make a contribution to identifying the true rate of co-infections and their correlation with the clinical symptoms and severity of disease.\n","id":"PMC7120114","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mieczyslaw","surname":"Pokorski","email":"m_pokorski@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"I.","surname":"Stefanska","email":"i.stefanska@gmail.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"I.","surname":"Stefanska","email":"i.stefanska@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"M.","surname":"Romanowska","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S.","surname":"Donevski","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"D.","surname":"Gawryluk","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"L.

studies showed that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is identified in about 70% of hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis during seasonal winter epidemics, followed by human metapneumovirus (hMPV, about 3–19%) or rhinoviruses (about 20%).\n Other respiratory viruses have also been reported, indicating significant causes of bronchiolitis and hospitalization during seasonal epidemics.\n The presence of more than one pathogen, and moreover, the association of RSV with rhinoviruses and also RSV with hMPV, may influence the natural course of bronchiolitis.\n A better understanding of these

diagnosed in 91.4% (32/35) of these cases; neither pneumonia nor any of the infectious disease pathogens evaluated occurred in three cows.\n The presence of multiple respiratory pathogens in 75%

lung, however, is the primary location where significant BRD lesions are usually found and is a common post?mortem diagnostic specimen.\n In this study, results of high?throughput virome sequencing, bacterial culture, targeted real?time PCR and histological examination of 130 bovine pneumonic lungs from western Canadian cattle were combined to explore associations of microorganisms with different types of pneumonia.\n Fibrinous bronchopneumonia (FBP) was the predominant type of pneumonia (46.2%, 60/130) and was associated with the detection of Mannheimia haemolytica.\n Detection of Histophilus somni and Pasteurella multocida was associated with suppurative bronchopneumonia (SBP) and concurrent bronchopneumonia and bronchointerstitial pneumonia (BP&amp;BIP), respectively.\n Sixteen viruses were identified, of which bovine parvovirus 2 (BPV2) was the most prevalent (11.5%, 15/130) followed by ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 (UTPV1, 8.5%, 11/130) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV,

immunosuppression in the affected individuals.\n Interestingly, no comparative/equivalent cases were found in domestic animals.\n This report describes the pathological and mycological findings associated with diphtheric aspergillosis tracheitis in an immunocompromised calf.\n The main pathological findings were diphtheric tracheitis and rhinitis, and necrotizing ruminitis associated with intralesional septate, acute branching fungal hyphae consistent with Aspergillus spp.\n Mycological culture and isolation confirmed the fungal hyphae as A.\n fumigatus due to characteristic features.\n Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays identified intralesional antigens of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and malignant catarrhal fever virus (MCFV) at the trachea and small intestine; IHC detected intralesional antigens of bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) only at the trachea.\n These findings confirmed the simultaneous occurrence of A.\n fumigatus with concomitant infections due to BVDV, MCFV, and BoHV-1 in this calf.\n Since ovine gammaherpesvirus-2 (OvHV-2) is the cause of MCF in Brail, it is likely that the intralesional MCFV antigens identified were those of OvHV-2. In this case, disseminated aspergillosis was probably associated with the undeveloped immunological status of the calf that was further impaired due to the combined immunodepressive effects of BVDV and BoHV-1 infections.\n Although BVDV and BoHV-1 are infectious disease pathogens frequently associated with the development of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in feedlot and dairy cattle, the identification of intralesional OvHV-2-like antigens in several parts of the lungs suggest that this MCFV also played a role in the BRD-associated lesions identified in this calf.\n","id":"PMC7476962","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Selwyn Arlington","surname":"Headley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Melissa Cristina","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thalita Evani Silva","surname":"de Oliveira","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Caroline Ambiel","surname":"Barros Gil Duarte","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Priscilla Fajardo","surname":"Valente Pereira","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marcos Vinícius","surname":"Vieira","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cristina Wetzel","surname":"Cunha","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eduardo Furtado","surname":"Flores","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Júlio Augusto Naylor","surname":"Lisbôa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lucienne Garcia","surname":"Pretto-Giordano","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JCM.32.7.1674-1679.1994","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibody in sheep and other ruminants to a conserved epitope of malignant catarrhal fever virus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1099/vir.0.81238-0","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A novel subgroup of rhadinoviruses in ruminants","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ocorrencia do virus da febre catarral maligna em bovinos do estado do Parana, Sul do Brasil: um estudo imuno-histoquimico retrospectivo [master's thesis]","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1177/030098588001700107","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The pathomorphology of malignant catarrhal fever: 1.

viral upper respiratory infection (URI) in children.\n The virus-induced host inflammatory response in the nasopharynx plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AOM.\n Suppression of this inflammatory process might prevent the development of AOM as a complication.\n Objective: We sought to assess the effect of intranasally administered fluticasone propionate on prevention of AOM during a viral respiratory infection.\n Methods: A total of 210 children (mean age, 2.1 years; range, 0.7-3.9 years) with normal middle ear status and URI of 48 hours’ duration or less were randomly allocated to receive either fluticasone (100 ?g twice daily) or placebo for 7 days.\n The specific viral cause of the infection was determined from nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained at the first visit.\n The children were re-examined at the end of the 7-day medication period.\n Results: In the fluticasone group AOM developed in 40 (38.1%) of 105 children compared with 29 (28.2%) of 103 children receiving placebo (P = .\n13).\n The viral cause of the respiratory infection was determined in 167 (86.1%) of 194 children from whom a nasopharyngeal aspirate was obtained.\n In children with rhinovirus

the development of AOM during URI but may increase the incidence of AOM during rhinovirus infection.\n (J Allergy Clin Immunol

young children with acute otitis media.\n Two cohorts of children (N?=?329 and 611) were followed from 2 to 24 months of age in Finland in two prospective studies (Finnish Otitis Media Cohort Study and Finnish Otitis Media Vaccine Trial).\n During the study period, nasopharyngeal and middle ear fluid specimens for each acute otitis media event were examined for eight (Cohort Study) or ten (Vaccine Trial) common respiratory viruses; adenoviruses, influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses, parechoviruses, and rhinoviruses.\n Picornaviruses (rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, and parechoviruses) were determined by reverse transcription PCR while antigen detection was used for the other viruses.\n A virus was present in either nasopharyngeal or middle ear specimen in 54% of events in the first cohort and in 67% of events in the second.\n Rhinoviruses formed the most common virus group detected (41–32%), followed by enteroviruses (25%, sought in the second cohort only) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (10%).\n All the other viruses represented jointly 8–10% of the events.\n In conclusion, using the methods described in this study, a specific virus infection was diagnosed in two thirds of all acute otitis media events in young children.\n Picornavirus RNA was detected in association with more than a half of all acute otitis media events.\n The use of PCR?based methods for the other respiratory viruses might have increased further the overall virus detection rate in acute otitis media.\n

Young Children: Interplay between Viruses and Bacteria","abstract":"Background\nHigh rates of potentially pathogenic bacteria and respiratory viruses can be detected in the upper respiratory tract of healthy children.\n\n Investigating presence of and associations between these pathogens in healthy individuals is still a rather unexplored field of research, but may have implications for interpreting findings during disease.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nWe selected 986 nasopharyngeal samples from 433 6- to 24-month-old healthy children that had participated in a randomized controlled trial.\n\n We determined the presence of 20 common respiratory viruses using real-time PCR.\n\n Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus were identified by conventional culture methods.\n\n Information on risk factors was obtained by questionnaires.\n\n We performed multivariate logistic regression analyses followed by partial correlation analysis to identify the overall pattern of associations.\n\n S.\n\n pneumoniae colonization was positively associated with the presence of H.\n\n influenzae (adjusted odds ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.18–2.16), M.\n\n catarrhalis (1.78, 1.29–2.47), human rhinoviruses (1.63, 1.19–2.22) and enteroviruses (1.97, 1.26–3.10), and negatively associated with S.\n\n aureus presence (0.59, 0.35–0.98).\n\n H.\n\n influenzae was positively associated with human rhinoviruses (1.63, 1.22–2.18) and respiratory syncytial viruses (2.78, 1.06–7.28).\n\n M.\n\n catarrhalis colonization was positively associated with coronaviruses (1.99, 1.01–3.93) and adenoviruses (3.69, 1.29–10.56), and negatively with S.\n\n aureus carriage (0.42, 0.25–0.69).\n\n We observed a strong positive association between S.\n\n aureus and influenza viruses (4.87, 1.59–14.89).\n\n In addition, human rhinoviruses and enteroviruses were positively correlated (2.40, 1.66–3.47), as were enteroviruses and human bocavirus, WU polyomavirus, parainfluenza viruses, and human parechovirus.\n\n A negative association was observed between human rhinoviruses and coronaviruses.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nOur data revealed high viral and bacterial prevalence rates and distinct bacterial-bacterial, viral-bacterial and viral-viral associations in healthy children, hinting towards the complexity and potential dynamics of microbial communities in the upper respiratory tract.\n\n This warrants careful consideration when associating microbial presence with specific respiratory diseases.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3474735","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Menno R.","surname":"van den

Southeast Asian tropical countries.\n\n In temperate countries, seasonal activity of respiratory viruses has been reported, particularly in association with temperature, while inconsistent correlation of respiratory viral activity with humidity and rain is found in tropical countries.\n\n A retrospective study was performed from 1982-2008 to investigate the viral etiology of children (? 5 years old) admitted with RTI in a tertiary hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 10269 respiratory samples from all children ? 5 years old received at the hospital's diagnostic virology laboratory between 1982-2008 were included in the study.\n\n Immunofluorescence staining (for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1-3, and adenovirus) and virus isolation were performed.\n\n The yearly hospitalization rates and annual patterns of laboratory-confirmed viral RTIs were determined.\n\n Univariate ANOVA was used to analyse the demographic parameters of cases.\n\n Multiple regression and Spearman's rank correlation were used to analyse the correlation between RSV cases and meteorological parameters.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 2708 cases were laboratory-confirmed using immunofluorescence assays and viral cultures, with the most commonly detected being RSV (1913, 70.6%), parainfluenza viruses (357, 13.2%), influenza viruses (297, 11.0%), and adenovirus (141, 5.2%).\n\n Children infected with RSV were significantly younger, and children infected with influenza viruses were significantly older.\n\n The four main viruses caused disease throughout the year, with a seasonal peak observed for RSV in September-December.\n\n Monthly RSV cases were directly correlated with rain days, and inversely correlated with relative humidity and temperature.\n\n\nConclusion\nViral RTIs, particularly due to RSV, are commonly detected in respiratory samples from hospitalized children in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\n As in temperate countries, RSV infection in tropical Malaysia also caused seasonal yearly epidemics, and this has implications for prophylaxis and vaccination programmes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3337250","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chee-Sieng","surname":"Khor","email":"jics_lab@yahoo.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"I-Ching","surname":"Sam","email":"jicsam@ummc.edu.my","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Poh-Sim","surname":"Hooi","email":"pshooi@ummc.edu.my","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kia-Fatt","surname":"Quek","email":"quek.kia.fatt@med.monash.edu.my","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yoke-Fun","surname":"Chan","email":"chanyf@ummc.edu.my","contributions":"1"}],"References":[{"doi":"10.1016/j.jcv.2008.03.002","date":"2008-03-03","title":"Emerging

extended incubation period often required for virus isolation.\n\n Alternative methodologies have been introduced in an effort to improve turnaround times.\n\n One such system, the R-mix™ shell vial is discussed herein.\n\n The study objectives were: (a) to establish R-mix™ testing parameters as compared to direct antigen testing (DAT) and CC, and (b) to assess technical aspects and cost of R-mix™ in a high volume clinical virology laboratory.\n\n\nStudy design\nA prospective analysis of respiratory samples submitted to the clinical virology laboratory between November 2004 and April 2005 was performed.\n\n All specimens were inoculated onto R-mix™ shell vials (SV) and CC tubes; and a subset also underwent DAT for influenza A and B and/or RSV.\n\n A retrospective estimated cost analysis was made.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 563 samples were included in the study, which collectively revealed a total of 207 viruses.\n\n Sensitivity of R-mix™ for seven major respiratory viruses ranged from 45% to 83% compared to CC and DAT, while mean time to detection (TTD) varied from 1.1 to 1.4 days.\n\n In addition to these viruses, 23 picornaviruses, 11 CMV isolates and 5 HSV isolates were detected by CC alone.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe R-mix™ system has similar sensitivity as CC for the detection of parainfluenza 1–3 and influenza A/B while dramatically reducing the TTD.\n\n Furthermore, it is significantly more sensitive and produces more timely results for RSV than CC; yet, neither method offers a diagnostic benefit over rapid DAT for RSV detection.\n\n The sensitivity

spread from southeast to northwest.\n Proximity to airports and being intersected by national highways or freeways but not railways were variables associated with the presence of the disease in a county.\n Lower temperature and lower relative humidity were the climatic factors facilitating local transmission after correction for the effects of school summer vacation and public holidays, as well as population density and the density of medical facilities.\n These findings indicate that interventions focused on domestic travel, population density, and climatic factors could play a role in

fibrosis","abstract":"Background\nPrevious studies have suggested a role played by respiratory viruses in the exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (CF).\n\n However, the impact of respiratory viruses could have been underestimated because of the low detection rate by conventional laboratory methods.\n\n\nMethods\nChildren with CF had nasal swabs and sputum samples obtained on a routine basis and when they developed respiratory exacerbations.\n\n Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification (NASBA) was used to detect respiratory viruses from nasal swabs.\n\n The definition of a respiratory exacerbation was when the symptom score totalled to 4 or more, or if the peak expiratory flow fell by more than 50 l/min from the child's usual best value, or if the parent subjectively felt that the child was developing a cold.\n\n\nResults\n71 patients had 165 reported episodes of respiratory exacerbations.\n\n 138 exacerbation samples were obtained of which 63 (46%) were positive for respiratory viruses.\n\n In contrast, 23 of 136 asymptomatic nasal swabs (16.9%) were positive for respiratory viruses.\n\n There was significantly more viruses being detected during respiratory

strong predictors for their presence.\n\n ‘Real-time’ NASBA has a rapid turn-around time and has the potential to aid clinical decision making, such as the use of anti-virals and administration of

structurally.\n\n This viral super-group, known for decades, has still to face the full force of a molecular biology onslaught.\n\n However, newly identified viruses (NIVs) including human metapneumovirus and bocavirus and emergent viruses including SARS-CoV have already been exhaustively scrutinized.\n\n The clinical impact of most respiratory NIVs is attributable to one or two major strains but there are 100+ distinct HRVs and, because we have never sought them independently, we must arbitrarily divide the literature's clinical impact findings among them.\n\n Early findings from infection studies and use of inefficient detection methods have shaped the way we think of ‘common cold’ viruses today.\n\n\nObjectives\nTo review past HRV-related studies in order to put recent HRV discoveries into context.\n\n\nResults\nHRV infections result in undue antibiotic prescriptions, sizable healthcare-related expenditure and exacerbation of expiratory wheezing associated with hospital admission.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe finding of many divergent and previously unrecognized HRV strains has drawn attention and resources back to the most widespread and frequent infectious agent of humans;

May 2010 from outpatients with fever or respiratory disease symptoms in the context of a pilot respiratory virus surveillance system.\n\n\nMethods\nSamples were assessed for the presence of 13 viruses, including influenza A virus, by MassTag PCR.\n\n\nResults\nAt least one virus was detected in 52% of 940 samples analyzed, with 3% showing co-infections.\n\n The most frequently detected agents were rhinoviruses and influenza A, all representing the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain.\n\n The incidence of influenza H1N1-positive samples was highest in late spring 2009, followed by a decline in summer and early fall, when rhinovirus infections became predominant before H1N1 reemerged in winter.\n\n Our study also identified a focal outbreak of enterovirus 68 in the early fall of 2009.\nConclusion\nMassTag multiplex PCR affords opportunities to track the epidemiology of infectious diseases and may guide clinicians and public health practitioners in influenza-like illness and outbreak management.\n\n Nonetheless, a substantial proportion of influenza-like illness remains unexplained underscoring the need for additional

increased fever and respiratory ED visits among children younger than 5 y during respiratory syncytial virus-predominant periods preceding epidemic influenza; and excess ED visits across all ages during the 2003–2004 (9.2 excess visits per 1,000 population) and 2004–2005 (5.2 excess visits per 1,000 population) A/H3N2 Fujian-lineage epidemics, with the relative impact shifted within and between seasons from younger to older ages.\n\n During each influenza epidemic period in the study, ED visits were increased among school-aged children, and each epidemic peaked among school-aged children before other impacted age groups.\n\n\nConclusions\nInfluenza-related morbidity in NYC was highly age- and strain-specific.\n\n The impact of reemerging B/Victoria-lineage influenza was focused primarily on school-aged children born since the virus was last widespread in the US, while epidemic A/Fujian-lineage influenza affected all age groups, consistent with a novel antigenic variant.\n\n The correspondence between predominant circulating viruses and excess ED visits, hospitalizations, and deaths shows that excess fever and respiratory ED visits provide a reliable surrogate measure of incident influenza-attributable morbidity.\n\n The highly age-specific impact of influenza by subtype and strain suggests that greater age detail be incorporated into ongoing surveillance.\n\n Influenza morbidity surveillance using electronic data currently available in many jurisdictions can provide timely and representative information about the age-specific epidemiology of circulating influenza viruses.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1939858","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Donald R","surname":"Olson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Richard T","surname":"Heffernan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Paladini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kevin","surname":"Konty","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Don","surname":"Weiss","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Farzad","surname":"Mostashari","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Neil M","surname":"Ferguson","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Neil M","surname":"Ferguson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1542/peds.112.6.1442","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Revised indications for the use of palivizumab and respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin intravenous for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infections.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Influenza B virus reinfection.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jclinepi.2004.08.014","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Influenza-like illness criteria were poorly related to laboratory-confirmed influenza in a sentinel surveillance study.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Methods for current statistical analysis of excess-pneumonia-influenza deaths.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1002/sim.4780080312","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Detection of aberrations in the occurrence of notifiable diseases surveillance data.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/00001648-199707000-00007","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A method for timely assessment of influenza-associated mortality in the United States.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid0303.970322","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Using laboratory-based surveillance data for prevention: an algorithm for detecting Salmonella outbreaks.","abstract":"By applying cumulative sums (CUSUM), a quality control method commonly used in manufacturing, we constructed a process for detecting unusual clusters among reported laboratory isolates of disease-causing organisms.\n We developed a computer algorithm based on minimal adjustments to the CUSUM method, which cumulates sums of the differences between frequencies of isolates and their expected means;

and for polymerase chain reaction of human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human boca virus (hBoV), and human corona virus.\n\n The clinical features and laboratory findings were recorded and analyzed.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 48 children were enrolled.\n\n RSV was the most common pathogen (41.7%), followed by hMPV (27.1%), hBoV, and enterovirus (both 6.3%).\n\n There were no significant differences in clinical presentation and disease severity between the RSV and hMPV groups.\n\n However, the hMPV group had a higher mixed infection rate (p = 0.038).\n\n Fourteen children had no identifiable viruses.\n\n Children with single, dual, and triple pathogens numbered 26, 7, and 1, respectively.\n\n The mixed infection rate reached 23.5% among 34 children with identifiable viruses.\n\n Children with a higher severity score had greater chance to develop asthma in the next 2 years (p = 0.042).\n\n\nConclusion\nRSV is the most common pathogen causing LRTIs in young children, followed by hMPV.\n\n The hMPV group had higher mixed infection rate than RSV group.\n\n hBoV does circulate in northern Taiwan.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7105033","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chi-Chun","surname":"Sung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hsin","surname":"Chi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nan-Chang","surname":"Chiu","email":"ncc88@ms2.mmh.org.tw","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daniel

respiratory epithelium.\n\n Few studies have documented the presence of RSV in the systemic circulation, however there is no consistent information whether virus detection in the blood correlates with disease severity.\n\n\nMethods\nBalb/c mice were inoculated with live RSV, heat-inactivated RSV or medium.\n\n A subset of RSV-infected mice was treated with anti-RSV antibody 72 h post-inoculation.\n\n RSV RNA loads were measured by PCR in peripheral blood from day 1-21 post-inoculation and were correlated with upper and lower respiratory tract viral loads, the systemic cytokine response, lung inflammation and pulmonary function.\n\n Immunohistochemical staining was used to define the localization of RSV antigens in the respiratory tract and peripheral blood.\n\n\nResults\nRSV RNA loads were detected in peripheral blood from day 1 to 14 post-inoculation, peaked on day 5 and significantly correlated with nasal and lung RSV loads, airway obstruction, and blood CCL2 and CXCL1 expression.\n\n Treatment with anti-RSV antibody reduced blood RSV RNA loads and improved airway obstruction.\n\n Immunostaining identified RSV antigens in alveolar macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes.\n\n\nConclusions\nRSV RNA was detected in peripheral blood upon infection with live RSV, followed a time-course parallel to viral loads assessed in the

respiratory tract infections (ARTIs), a 2?year study was conducted in Beijing, China, from May 2005 to July 2007. Nose and throat swab samples from 5808 ARTI patients were analysed by PCR methods for common respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses (IFVs) A, B, and C, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1–4, enteroviruses (EVs), human rhinoviruses (HRVs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human coronaviruses (HCoVs) OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1, and adenoviruses (ADVs).\n Viral pathogens were detected in 34.6% of patient samples, and 1.6% of the patients tested positive for more than one virus.\n IFVs (19.3%) were the dominant agents detected, followed by HRVs (6.5%), PIVs (4.3%), EVs (3.2%), and HCoVs (1.1%).\n ADVs, RSV and HMPV were also detected (&lt;1%).\n The viral detection rates differed significantly between infections of the lower and upper respiratory tracts in the sample population: PIVs, the second most commonly detected viral agents in lower acute respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), were more prevalent than in upper acute respiratory tract infections, indicating that the pathogenic role of PIVs in LRTIs should be investigated.\n Currently, this study is the largest?scale investigation of respiratory virus infections in China with multiple agent detection, providing baseline data for further studies of respiratory virus infections in adults with ARTIs.\n","id":"PMC7129754","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"L.","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"R.","surname":"Gonzalez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Z.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Z.","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"H.","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"J.","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Q.","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"J.","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"L.","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"W.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"T.","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"X.","surname":"Meng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"G.","surname":"Vernet","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"G.","surname":"Paranhos?Baccalà","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"J.","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Q.","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"J.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Simultaneous

A single virus was detected in 373 patients (45.7%), and two to four viruses in 113 patients (13.8%).\n\n The most frequent causative viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (24.7%), human bocavirus (24.5%), and human rhinovirus (HRV) (15%).\n\n RSV was more prevalent in winter and among young infants.\n\n Cases of seasonal influenza A and B viruses were reported mainly in January and August.\n\n An increase in adenovirus infection was observed during the spring of the second year of the study.\n\n Sequence analyses showed multiple introductions of different virus subtypes and identified a high prevalence of the newly defined HRV-C species.\n\n A higher viral incidence was observed during the winter of 2008, which was unusually cold.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study supports the usefulness of multiplex RT-PCR for virus detection and co-infection, and for implementation of a molecular monitoring system for endemic and epidemic viral respiratory

evaluate ILI national sentinel criteria and viral etiologies in adults diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI) and/or ILI from 2001 to 2003 in Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n Clinical and laboratory evaluations were observed from 420 adults and collected on a daily basis from outpatient care units at University Hospital.\n The ILI definition included: fever plus at least one respiratory symptom (cough and/or sore throat) and one constitutional symptom (headache, malaise, myalgia, sweat or chills, or fatigue).\n DFA and RT?PCR for influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, and metapneumovirus were performed on nasal washes and 61.8% resulted positive.\n The respiratory viruses detected most often were influenza and rhinovirus.\n ILI was reported for 240/420 patients (57.1%), with influenza and rhinovirus etiologies accounting for 30.9% and 19.6%, respectively.\n Rhinovirus peak activity was concurrent with the

etiology of respiratory infections in children under 5 years old living in tropical rural areas of Senegal: The EVIRA project","abstract":"Acute respiratory infection is one of the leading causes of child morbidity, especially in developing countries.\n Viruses are recognized as the predominant causative agents of acute respiratory infections.\n In Senegal, few data concerning the causes of respiratory infections are available, and those known relate mainly to classical influenza infections.\n Clinical and virological surveillance of acute respiratory infections was carried out in a rural community in children less than 5 years old.\n A standardized questionnaire was used and a nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected from each patient.\n These samples were tested for the detection of 20 respiratory viruses by multiplex RT?PCR or by viral culture.\n A total of 82 acute respiratory episodes were included, and 48 (58.5%) were found to be positive, with a total of 55 viral detections; several samples were positive for two (n?=?5) or 3 (n?=?1) viruses.\n Ten different viruses were identified: influenza viruses A, B, and C (n?=?25), human respiratory syncytial virus type A (n?=?13), rhinoviruses (n?=?8), human coronaviruses type 229E and NL63 (n?=?6), parainfluenza viruses 3 and 4 (n?=?2), and bocavirus (n?=?1).\n These results provide evidence on the importance and the diversity of viruses as causative agents of acute respiratory infections in children living in a rural community in Senegal.\n The establishment of sentinel surveillance sites could help estimate the burden of acute respiratory infection in the pediatric population and should help prepare the health care systems to identify and respond to new viral respiratory emergencies.\n J.\n

in Antananarivo, Madagascar, July 2008 to June 2009","abstract":"Background\nIn Madagascar, despite an influenza surveillance established since 1978, little is known about the etiology and prevalence of viruses other than influenza causing influenza-like illnesses (ILIs).\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nFrom July 2008 to June 2009, we collected respiratory specimens from patients who presented ILIs symptoms in public and private clinics in Antananarivo (the capital city of Madagascar).\n\n ILIs were defined as body temperature ?38°C and cough and at least two of the following symptoms: sore throat, rhinorrhea, headache and muscular pain, for a maximum duration of 3 days.\n\n We screened these specimens using five multiplex real time Reverse Transcription and/or Polymerase Chain Reaction assays for detection of 14 respiratory viruses.\n\n We detected respiratory viruses in 235/313 (75.1%) samples.\n\n Overall influenza virus A (27.3%) was the most common virus followed by rhinovirus (24.8%), RSV (21.2%), adenovirus (6.1%), coronavirus OC43 (6.1%), influenza virus B (3.9%), parainfluenza virus-3 (2.9%), and parainfluenza virus-1 (2.3%).\n\n Co-infections occurred in 29.4% (69/235) of infected patients and rhinovirus was the most detected virus (27.5%).\n\n Children under 5 years were more likely to have one or more detectable virus associated with their ILI.\n\n In this age group, compared to those ?5 years, the risk of detecting more than one virus was higher (OR?=?1.9), as was the risk of detecting of RSV (OR?=?10.1) and adenovirus (OR?=?4.7).\n\n While rhinovirus and adenovirus infections occurred year round, RSV, influenza virus A and coronavirus OC43 had defined period of circulation.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn our study, we found that respiratory viruses play an important role in ILIs in the Malagasy community, particularly in children under 5 years old.\n\n These data provide a better understanding of the viral etiology of outpatients with ILI and describe for the first time importance of these viruses in different age group and their period of circulation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3048401","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Norosoa

(21/42).\n\n Among common viral pathogens detected, significant differences in age distributions were observed in seasonal influenza virus A (sFulA, H3N2) and B (sFluB), pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza viruses (H1N1pdm09), RSV, and adenovirus (ADV).\n\n Infections with sFluA (H3N2), sFluB, RSV, and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) had characteristic seasonal patterns.\n\n The incidences of sFluA (H3N2), ADV, and RSV correlated with air temperature.\n\n Alternatively, the incidence of sFluB correlated with relative air humidity.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese results demonstrate that a wide range of respiratory viral pathogens are circulating in Zhuhai city.\n\n This information needs to be considered by clinicians when treating patients presenting with ILI.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3655035","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hongxia","surname":"Li","email":"hongxiast@sina.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Quande","surname":"Wei","email":"quandew@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Aijun","surname":"Tan","email":"zhcdc@sina.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Leyi","surname":"Wang","email":"wang.1074@buckeyemail.osu.edu","contributions":"1"}],"References":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Acute

respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains unknown.\n\n We aimed to estimate the global incidence of and mortality from episodes of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) due to RSV in children younger than 5 years in 2005.\nMethods\nWe estimated the incidence of RSV-associated ALRI in children younger than 5 years, stratified by age, using data from a systematic review of studies published between January, 1995, and June, 2009, and ten unpublished population-based studies.\n\n We estimated possible boundaries for RSV-associated ALRI mortality by combining case fatality ratios with incidence estimates from hospital-based reports from published and unpublished studies and identifying studies with population-based data for RSV seasonality and monthly ALRI mortality.\n\n\nFindings\nIn 2005, an estimated 33·8 (95% CI 19·3–46·2) million new episodes of RSV-associated ALRI occurred worldwide in children younger than 5 years (22% of ALRI episodes), with at least 3·4 (2·8–4·3) million episodes representing severe RSV-associated ALRI necessitating hospital admission.\n\n We estimated that 66?000–199?000 children younger than 5 years died from RSV-associated ALRI in 2005, with 99% of these deaths occurring in developing countries.\n\n Incidence and mortality can vary substantially from year to year in any one setting.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGlobally, RSV is the most common cause of childhood ALRI and a major cause of admission to hospital as a result of severe ALRI.\n\n Mortality data suggest that RSV is an important cause of death in childhood from ALRI, after pneumococcal pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae type b.\n\n The development of novel prevention and treatment strategies should be accelerated as a priority.\n\n\nFunding\nWHO; Bill &amp; Melinda Gates

little is known about the etiology of these acute respiratory illnesses in many regions of South America.\n\n In 2006, the Peruvian Ministry of Health (MoH) and the US Naval Medical Research Center Detachment (NMRCD) initiated a collaboration to characterize the viral agents associated with ILI and to describe the clinical and epidemiological presentation of the affected population.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nPatients with ILI (fever ?38°C and cough or sore throat) were evaluated in clinics and hospitals in 13 Peruvian cities representative of the four main regions of the country.\n\n Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs, as well as epidemiological and demographic data, were collected from each patient.\n\n During the two years of this study (June 2006 through May 2008), a total of 6,835 patients, with a median age of 13 years, were recruited from 31 clinics and hospitals; 6,308 were enrolled by regular passive surveillance and 527 were enrolled as part of outbreak investigations.\n\n At least one respiratory virus was isolated from the specimens of 2,688 (42.6%) patients, with etiologies varying by age and geographical region.\n\n Overall the most common viral agents isolated were influenza A virus (25.1%), influenza B virus (9.7%), parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3, (HPIV-1,-2,-3; 3.2%), herpes simplex virus (HSV; 2.6%), and adenoviruses (1.8%).\n\n Genetic analyses of influenza virus isolates demonstrated that three lineages of influenza A H1N1, one lineage of influenza A H3N2, and two lineages of influenza B were circulating in Peru during the course of this study.\n\n\nConclusions\nTo our knowledge this is the most comprehensive study to date of the etiologic agents associated with ILI in Peru.\n\n These results demonstrate that

for hospitalization in childhood.\n\n More than 80% of URTIs are viral.\n\n Etiological diagnosis of URTIs is important to make correct clinical decisions on treatment methods.\n\n However, data for viral spectrum of URTIs are very limited in Shanghai children.\n\n\nMethods\nNasopharyngeal swabs were collected from a group of 164 children aged below 3 years who were hospitalized due to acute respiratory infection from May 2009 to July 2010 in Shanghai.\n\n A VRDAL multiplex PCR for 10 common respiratory viruses was performed on collected specimens compared with the Seeplex® RV15 ACE Detection kit for 15 respiratory viruses.\n\n\nResults\nViruses were detected in 84 (51.2%) patients by VRDAL multiplex PCR, and 8 (4.9%) of cases were mixed infections.\n\n Using the Seeplex® RV15 ACE Detection kit, viruses were detected in 129 (78.7%) patients, 49 (29.9%) were co-infected cases.\n\n Identified viruses included 37 of human rhinovirus (22.6% of cases), 32 of influenza A virus (19.5%), 30 of parainfluenzavirus-2 (18.3%), 23 of parainfluenzavirus-3 (14.0%), 15 of human enterovirus (9.1%), 14 each of parainfluenzavirus-1, respiratory syncytial virus B and adenovirus (8.5%), 8

be similar to nonpandemic influenza, both in the community and in long-term care facilities.\n Attack rates in nursing homes are approximately 5–10% per year with significant rates of pneumonia (10–20%) and death (2–5%).\n Estimates using US healthcare databases and viral surveillance results over a 9-year period indicate that RSV infection causes approximately 10 000 all-cause deaths annually among persons &gt;64 years of age.\n In contrast, influenza A accounted for approximately 37 000 yearly deaths in the same age group.\n The clinical features of RSV infection may be difficult to distinguish from those of influenza but include nasal congestion, cough, wheezing and low-grade fever.\n Older persons with underlying heart and lung disease and immunocompromised patients are at highest risk for RSV infection-related pneumonia and death.\n Diagnosis of RSV infection in adults is difficult because viral culture and antigen detection are insensitive, presumably because of low viral titres.\n The combination of serology and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay offers the best sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of RSV but unfortunately these techniques are not widely available; consequently, most adult RSV disease goes unrecognised.\n Although treatment of RSV infection in the elderly is largely supportive, early therapy with ribavirin and intravenous ?-globulin improves survival in immunocompromised persons.\n An effective RSV vaccine has not yet been developed.\n Therefore, prevention of RSV is limited to standard infection control practices, such as hand washing and the use of gowns and gloves.\n","id":"PMC7099998","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ann

age-specific health care utilization is necessary to guide effective prevention strategies.\n\n This retrospective database analysis assessed the incidence rates of RSV-related health care utilization in the USA over a 7-year period.\n\n\nMethods\nEpisodes of RSV were identified in the Truven Health MarketScan® Commercial Claims and Encounters database between 2008 and 2014 using ICD-9-CM codes for pneumonia, bronchiolitis and RSV (480-486, 487.0, 466.1, 491.2, 079.6).\n\n Annual RSV-related health care utilization was calculated for the total population, by age group (&lt;1, 1, 2-4, 5-17, 18-49, 50-64, 65-74, 75-84 and ?85 years) and the proportion of cases for each setting (hospitalization, outpatient, or emergency department [ED] / urgent care [UC]).\n\n\nResults\nOver the 7-year study period, the mean rate of all RSV-associated health care utilization was 2.4 per 1000 person-years, with mean rates ranging from 2.0 to 2.6).\n\n The highest rate was seen in infants aged &lt;1 year (mean 79.0 per 1000 over the 7-year period), which decreased with increasing age in the range 2-49 years before increasing with age in older adults (mean rate 8.1 per 1000 over the 7-year period in those ?85 years).\n\n Of all RSV cases, 82% were reported in an outpatient setting, 11% in the ED/UC and 7% were hospitalized.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe annual RSV-related healthcare utilization rates were substantial, especially in infants and young children.\n\n These results underscore the need to accelerate the development of RSV prevention strategies to reduce the healthcare burden of RSV.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7568930","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sabine","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Caroline","surname":"Amand","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexia","surname":"Kieffer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Moe

in young children (&lt;?5?years old) and older adults (??65?years old) leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to recommend the implementation of a dedicated surveillance in countries.\n\n\nAim\nWe tested the capacity of the severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) hospital network to contribute to RSV surveillance in Belgium.\n\n\nMethods\nDuring the 2018/19 influenza season, we started the SARI surveillance for influenza in Belgium in week?40, earlier than in the past, to follow RSV activity, which usually precedes influenza virus circulation.\n\n While the WHO SARI case definition for influenza normally used by the SARI hospital network was employed, flexibility over the fever criterion was allowed, so patients without fever but meeting the other case definition criteria could be included in the surveillance.\n\n\nResults\nBetween weeks?40 2018 and 2 2019, we received 508 samples from SARI patients.\n\n We found an overall RSV detection rate of 62.4% (317/508), with rates varying depending on the age group: 77.6% in?children aged?&lt;?5?years (253/326) and 34.4% in adults aged???65?years (44/128).\n\n Over 90% of the RSV-positive samples also positive for another tested respiratory virus (80/85) were from children aged?&lt;?5?years.\n\n Differences were also noted between age groups for symptoms, comorbidities and complications.\n\n\nConclusion\nWith only marginal modifications in the case definition and the period of surveillance, the Belgian SARI network would be able to substantially contribute to RSV surveillance and burden evaluation in children and older adults, the two groups of particular interest for WHO.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7531071","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lorenzo","surname":"Subissi","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Nathalie","surname":"Bossuyt","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Nathalie","surname":"Bossuyt","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marijke","surname":"Reynders","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Michèle","surname":"Gérard","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Michèle","surname":"Gérard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicolas","surname":"Dauby","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Bourgeois","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Bourgeois","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bénédicte","surname":"Delaere","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Sophie","surname":"Quoilin","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Steven","surname":"Van

influenza: Extending influenza surveillance to detect non-influenza respiratory viruses of public health relevance: analysis of surveillance data, Belgium, 2015 to 2019","abstract":"Background\nSeasonal influenza-like illness (ILI) affects millions of people yearly.\n\n Severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), mainly influenza, are a leading cause of hospitalisation and mortality.\n\n Increasing evidence indicates that non-influenza respiratory viruses (NIRV) also contribute to the burden of SARI.\n\n In Belgium, SARI surveillance by a network of sentinel hospitals has been ongoing since 2011.\nAim\nWe report the results of using in-house multiplex qPCR for the detection of a flexible panel of viruses in respiratory ILI and SARI samples and the estimated incidence rates of SARI associated with each virus.\n\n\nMethods\nWe defined ILI as an illness with onset of fever and cough or dyspnoea.\n\n SARI was defined as an illness requiring hospitalisation with onset of fever and cough or dyspnoea within the previous 10 days.\n\n Samples were collected in four winter seasons and tested by multiplex qPCR for influenza virus and NIRV.\n\n Using catchment population estimates, we calculated incidence rates of SARI associated with each virus.\n\n\nResults\nOne third of the SARI cases were positive for NIRV, reaching 49.4% among children younger than 15 years.\n\n In children younger than 5 years, incidence rates of NIRV-associated SARI were twice that of influenza (103.5 vs 57.6/100,000 person-months); co-infections with several NIRV, respiratory syncytial viruses, human metapneumoviruses and picornaviruses contributed most (33.1, 13.6, 15.8 and 18.2/100,000 person-months, respectively).\n\n\nConclusion\nEarly testing for

subjects with ILI or SARI during the five influenza seasons before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Sicily (Italy).\n Respiratory specimens from ILI outpatients and SARI inpatients were collected in the framework of the Italian Network for the Influenza Surveillance and molecularly tested for hRSV-A and hRSV-B.\n Overall, 8.1% of patients resulted positive for hRSV.\n Prevalence peaked in the age-groups &lt;5 years old (range: 17.6–19.1%) and ?50 years old (range: 4.8–5.1%).\n While the two subgroups co-circulated throughout the study period, hRSV-B was slightly predominant over hRSV-A, except for the season 2019–2020 when hRSV-A strongly prevailed (82.9%).\n In the community setting, the distribution of hRSV subgroups was balanced (47.8% vs.\n 49.7% for hRSV-A and hRSV-B, respectively), while most infections identified in the hospital setting were caused by hRSV-B (69.5%); also, this latter one was more represented among hRSV cases with underlying diseases, as

Having a patient-facing role and working outside your home were important risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the end of the first wave (April 26 to June 28, 2020), but not in the second wave (from the end of August to Nov 1, 2020).\n\n Age (young adults, particularly those aged 17–24 years) was an important initial driver of increased positivity rates in the second wave.\n\n For example, the estimated percentage of individuals testing positive was more than six times higher in those aged 17–24 years than in those aged 70 years or older at the end of September, 2020. A substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms around their positive test (45–68%, dependent on calendar time.\n\n\nInterpretation\nImportant risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 varied substantially between the part of the first wave that was captured by the study (April to June, 2020) and the first part of the second wave of increased positivity rates (end of August to Nov 1, 2020), and a substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be important for managing the COVID-19 pandemic moving forwards.\n\n\nFunding\nDepartment of Health and Social Care.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7786000","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Koen B","surname":"Pouwels","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"House","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Emma","surname":"Pritchard","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Julie V","surname":"Robotham","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paul J","surname":"Birrell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andrew","surname":"Gelman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Karina-Doris","surname":"Vihta","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Nikola","surname":"Bowers","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ian","surname":"Boreham","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Heledd","surname":"Thomas","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"James","surname":"Lewis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Iain","surname":"Bell","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"John I","surname":"Bell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"John N","surname":"Newton","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jeremy","surname":"Farrar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ian","surname":"Diamond","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Pete","surname":"Benton","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ann Sarah","surname":"Walker","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Koen B.","surname":"Pouwels","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"A.

severe respiratory distress.\n The aim of this study was to investigate respiratory infections in children treated in a hospital intensive care unit (ICU).\n Assays were performed using the CLART® Pneumovir DNA array assay (Genomica, Coslada, Madrid, Spain), which makes it possible to detect 11 genus of respiratory viruses simultaneously.\n During the winter of 2008–2009, 73 respiratory specimens collected from 53 children under 2 years of age and admitted to an ICU were tested.\n At least one virus was detected in 78% (57/73) of the samples.\n The virological diagnosis was based on single infections in 65% (37/57) and on multiple infections in 35% (20/57) of cases.\n The array assay revealed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 73.6% (42/57) of the samples and rhinovirus in 24.6% (14/57), either on their own or in co?infections.\n All viruses identified in single and multiple infections were tested, taking into account clinical features, risk factors, and severity criteria.\n Children with no risk factors presented more multiple infections, up to 42% of cases, than children with at least one risk factor.\n RSV seemed to induce severe symptoms by itself as no difference in intubation needs was observed when RSV was detected on its own or in co?infection.\n The CLART® Pneumovir DNA array was useful for examining severe viral respiratory infections, when other viruses than those detected by conventional methods could be involved, particularly in an ICU.\n J.\n Med.\n Virol.\n 83:150–155, 2011. © 2010 Wiley?Liss,

mortality.\n\n\nObjectives\nThis study was conducted to determine the prevalence and seasonal distribution of respiratory viruses in our region, in children and adults with a pre-diagnosis of ARTI.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 845 nasopharyngeal swab specimens were analyzed with the RespiFinder Smart 22 kit (PathoFinder BV, Netherlands) and the Rotor-Gene 6000 real-time PCR system.\n\n\nResults\nAt least one pathogen was detected in 612 (72.4%) of the specimens.\n\n Overall, 902 pathogens were detected; 821 (91%) were viruses and 81 (9%) were bacteria.\n\n The most commonly detected pathogens were influenza A virus (IFV-A) (n = 219), influenza B virus (IFV-B) (n=157), rhinovirus/enterovirus (n = 107), human bocavirus (HBoV) (n = 91), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A/B (n = 64), adenovirus (n = 56), human coronaviruses (n = 51), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 49), parainfluenza viruses (n = 40), human metapneumovirus (n = 36), Bordetella pertussis (n = 15), Legionella pneumophila (n = 11), and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (n = 6), respectively.\n\n Among the 215 (25.4%) co-infected cases, IFV-A/HBoV and IFV-A/IFV-B were the most common co-infections.\n\n IFV-A was the most prevalent agent in all age groups except for children under 5 years of age, in whom RSV A/B was the most common pathogen.\n\n Approximately two thirds of the respiratory viruses were detected in early spring and winter, with peaks in January, March, and April.\n\n\nConclusions\nWith regard to the prevalence and seasonal distribution of respiratory viruses, our epidemiological data for the 2014 - 2015 season in Istanbul showed a predominance of IFV-A infections with a peak activity in early spring.\n\n Enhanced surveillance and early detection of respiratory viral pathogens can be useful in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of ARTIs, and for guiding the development of appropriate public health

cases.\n\n Multiple regression and Spearman's rank correlation were used to analyse the correlation between RSV cases and meteorological parameters.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 2708 cases were laboratory-confirmed using immunofluorescence assays and viral cultures, with the most commonly detected being RSV (1913, 70.6%), parainfluenza viruses (357, 13.2%), influenza viruses (297, 11.0%), and adenovirus (141, 5.2%).\n\n Children infected with RSV were significantly younger, and children infected with influenza viruses were significantly older.\n\n The four main viruses caused disease throughout the year, with a seasonal peak observed for RSV in September-December.\n\n Monthly RSV cases were directly correlated with rain days, and inversely correlated with relative humidity and temperature.\n\n\nConclusion\nViral RTIs, particularly due to RSV, are commonly detected in respiratory samples from hospitalized children in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\n As in temperate countries, RSV infection in tropical Malaysia also caused seasonal yearly epidemics, and this has implications for prophylaxis and vaccination programmes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3337250","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chee-Sieng","surname":"Khor","email":"jics_lab@yahoo.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"I-Ching","surname":"Sam","email":"jicsam@ummc.edu.my","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Poh-Sim","surname":"Hooi","email":"pshooi@ummc.edu.my","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kia-Fatt","surname":"Quek","email":"quek.kia.fatt@med.monash.edu.my","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yoke-Fun","surname":"Chan","email":"chanyf@ummc.edu.my","contributions":"0"}],"References":[{"doi":"10.1016/j.jcv.2008.03.002","date":"2008-03-03","title":"Emerging

antigen tests and conventional cell culture for respiratory virus detection","abstract":"Background and objectives\nConventional cell culture (CC) has limited clinical utility as a result of the extended incubation period often required for virus isolation.\n\n Alternative methodologies have been introduced in an effort to improve turnaround times.\n\n One such system, the R-mix™ shell vial is discussed herein.\n\n The study objectives were: (a) to establish R-mix™ testing parameters as compared to direct antigen testing (DAT) and CC, and (b) to assess technical aspects and cost of R-mix™ in a high volume clinical virology laboratory.\n\n\nStudy design\nA prospective analysis of respiratory samples submitted to the clinical virology laboratory between November 2004 and April 2005 was performed.\n\n All specimens were inoculated onto R-mix™ shell vials (SV) and CC tubes; and a subset also underwent DAT for influenza A and B and/or RSV.\n\n A retrospective estimated cost analysis was made.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 563 samples were included in the study, which collectively revealed a total of 207 viruses.\n\n Sensitivity of R-mix™ for seven major respiratory viruses ranged from 45% to 83% compared to CC and DAT, while mean time to detection (TTD) varied from 1.1 to 1.4 days.\n\n In addition to these viruses, 23 picornaviruses, 11 CMV isolates and 5 HSV isolates were detected by CC alone.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe R-mix™ system has similar sensitivity as CC for the detection of parainfluenza 1–3 and influenza A/B while dramatically reducing the TTD.\n\n Furthermore, it is significantly more sensitive and produces more timely results for RSV than CC; yet, neither method offers a diagnostic benefit over rapid DAT for RSV detection.\n\n The sensitivity of R-mix™ for adenovirus appears to be significantly lower than that of CC.\n\n Lastly, methodologies other than R-mix™ must remain in place under circumstances where identification of other potential viral respiratory pathogens, including herpesviruses and picornaviruses, is desired.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7108409","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"P.

young children and immunosuppressed patients.\n Objectives: To rapidly and accurately quantify and subtype RSV in respiratory samples, we developed and evaluated two real-time RT-PCR assays.\n Study design: A quantitative assay was designed using primers for a consensus region of the matrix protein gene and a subtype-specific assay for RSV-A and RSV-B detection was designed using primers for the polymerase gene.\n Quantitative RSV RT-PCR results of pediatric nasal wash samples submitted to the University of Washington Virology Laboratory from December 2002, through May 2003, were compared to those of an indirect fluorescent antibody RSV antigen detection assay (FA).\n Results: Specificity of the RT-PCR assay was high, with no amplification of eleven common respiratory viruses and eight herpes viruses.\n Among 751 samples, RSV was detected in 267 (35.6%) by FA and in 286 (38.1%) by RT-PCR.\n Median RSV copy number in nasal wash samples that were positive by both FA and RT-PCR was 2.5×107 copies/mL versus a median of 3.0×104 copies/mL for samples positive by RT-PCR only (P&lt;0.001).\n The detection and quantity of RSV in respiratory specimens was associated with younger age, but not with gender or hospitalization.\n Among positive samples from this Seattle cohort, 52% were subtype A and 48% were subtype B.\n Both subtypes were detected with similar viral loads among all patient groups (stratified by age, gender, and hospitalization), and throughout the specimen collection period.\n Conclusions: These real-time RT-PCR assays provide a rapid, specific, and highly sensitive alternative for detecting, quantifying, and subtyping RSV in clinical specimens.\n","id":"PMC7128826","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jane","surname":"Kuypers","email":"jane.kuypers@seattlechildrens.org","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nancy","surname":"Wright","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rhoda","surname":"Morrow","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JCM.01739-07","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Real-time

the precise role that HCoVs play in RTIs is greatly underestimated.\n We describe a rapid, sensitive, and highly specific quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction

are limited.\n Surveillance for ARI was conducted at two hospitals in Guatemala.\n Patients admitted with at least one sign of acute infection and one sign or symptom of respiratory illness met the criteria for a case of hospitalized ARI.\n Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs were collected and tested by polymerase chain reaction for adenovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1,2 and 3, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B viruses, human metapneumovirus, Chlamydia pneumioniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.\n Urine specimens were tested for Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen.\n Blood culture and chest radiograph were done at the discretion of the treating physician.\n Between November 2007 and December 2011, 3,964 case-patients were enrolled.\n While cases occurred among all age groups, 2,396 (60.4%) cases occurred in children &lt;5 years old and 463 (11.7%) among adults ?65 years old.\n Viruses were found in 52.6% of all case-patients and 71.8% of those aged &lt;1 year old; the most frequently detected was respiratory syncytial virus, affecting 26.4% of case-patients.\n Urine antigen testing for Streptococcus pneumoniae performed for case-patients ?15 years old was positive in 15.1% of those tested.\n Among 2,364 (59.6%) of case-patients with a radiograph, 907 (40.0%) had findings suggestive of bacterial pneumonia.\n Overall, 230 (5.9%) case-patients died during the hospitalization.\n Using population denominators, the observed hospitalized ARI incidence was 128 cases per 100,000, with the highest rates seen among children &lt;1 year old (1,703 per 100,000), followed by adults ?65 years old (292 per 100,000).\n These data, which demonstrate a substantial burden of hospitalized ARI in Guatemala due to a variety of pathogens, can help guide public health policies aimed at reducing the burden of illness and death due to respiratory infections.\n","id":"PMC3877070","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jennifer

causative for respiratory tract infections, but symptoms are mostly similar.\n\n Therefore, the identification of the causative viruses and bacteria is only feasible using multiplex PCR or several monoplex PCR tests in parallel.\n\n\nMethods\nThe analytical sensitivity of three multiplex PCR assays, RespiFinder-19, RespiFinder-SMART-22 and xTAG-Respiratory-Virus-Panel-Fast-Assay (RVP), were compared to monoplex real-time PCR with quantified standardized control material.\n\n All assays include the most common respiratory pathogens.\n\n\nResults\nTo compare the analytical sensitivity of the multiplex assays, samples were inoculated with 13 different quantified viruses in the range of 101 to 105 copies/ml.\n\n Concordant results were received for rhinovirus, whereas the RVP detected influenzavirus, RSV and hMPV more frequently in low concentrations.\n\n The RespiFinder-19 and the RespiFinder-SMART-22 showed a higher analytical sensitivity for adenoviruses and coronaviruses, whereas the RVP was incapable to detect adenovirus and coronavirus in concentrations of 104 copies/ml.\n\n The RespiFinder-19 and RespiFinder-SMART-22A did not detect influenzaviruses (104 copies/ml) and RSV (103 copies/ml).\n\n The detection of all 13 viruses in one sample was only achieved using monoplex PCR.\n\n To analyze possible competitive amplification reactions between the different viruses, samples were further inoculated with only 4 different viruses in one sample.\n\n Compared to the detection of 13 viruses in parallel, only a few differences were found.\n\n\nConclusions\nMultiplex PCR tests have a broad spectrum of pathogens to test at a time.\n\n Analysis of multiple inoculated samples revealed a different focus of the detected virus types by the three assays.\n\n Analysis of clinical samples showed a high concordance of detected viruses by the RespiFinder-19 compared to monoplex

French market, including 2 detecting viruses and atypical bacteria (from Pathofinder and Seegene companies) and 4 detecting only viruses (from Abbott, Genomica, Qiagen and Seegene companies).\n The respective sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and agreement of each multiplex technique were calculated by comparison to commercial duplex PCR tests (Argene/bioMérieux) used as gold standard.\n Eighty-eight respiratory specimens with no pathogen (n?=?11), single infections (n?=?33) or co-infections (n?=?44) were selected to cover 9 viruses or groups of viruses and 3 atypical bacteria.\n All samples were extracted using the NUCLISENS® easyMAG™ instrument (bioMérieux).\n The overall sensitivity ranged from 56.25% to 91.67% for viruses and was below 50% with both tests for bacteria.\n The overall specificity was excellent (&gt;94% for all pathogens).\n For each tested kit, the overall agreement with the reference test was strong for viruses (kappa test &gt;0.60) and moderate for bacteria.\n After the extraction step, the hands-on time varied from 50 min to 2h30 and the complete results were available in 2h30 to 9 h.\n The spectrum of tested agents and the technology used to reveal the PCR products as well as the laboratory organization are determinant for the selection of a

Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe potential role of respiratory viruses in the natural history of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults has not been well described since the advent of nucleic amplification tests (NATs).\n\n\nMethods\nFrom 2004 to 2006, adults with CAP who were admitted to five hospitals were prospectively enrolled in the study, and clinical data, cultures, serology, and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained.\n\n NATs from swabs were tested for influenza, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus 1–4, coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, and NL63), and adenovirus.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 193 patients were included; the median age was 71 years, 51% of patients were male, and 47% of patients had severe CAP.\n\n Overall, 75 patients (39%) had a pathogen identified.\n\n Of these pathogens, 29 were viruses (15%), 38 were bacteria (20%), 8 were mixed (4%), and the rest were “unknown.\n\n” Influenza (n = 7), hMPV (n = 7), and RSV (n = 5) accounted for most viral infections; other infections included rhinovirus (n = 4), parainfluenza (n = 3), coronavirus (n = 4), and adenovirus (n = 2).\n\n Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common bacterial infection (37%).\n\n Compared with bacterial infection, patients with viral infection were older (76 vs 64 years, respectively; p = 0.01), were more likely to have cardiac disease (66% vs 32%, respectively; p = 0.006), and were more frail (eg, 48% with limited ambulation vs 21% of bacterial infections; p = 0.02).\n\n There were few clinically meaningful differences in presentation and no differences in outcomes according to the presence or absence of viral infection.\n\n\nConclusions\nViral infections are common in adults with pneumonia.\n\n Easily transmissible viruses such as influenza, hMPV, and RSV were the most common, raising concerns about infection control.\n\n Routine testing for respiratory viruses may be warranted for adults who have been hospitalized with pneumonia.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7094572","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jennie","surname":"Johnstone","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sumit

respiratory tract infections (ARTIs), a 2?year study was conducted in Beijing, China, from May 2005 to July 2007. Nose and throat swab samples from 5808 ARTI patients were analysed by PCR methods for common respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses (IFVs) A, B, and C, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1–4, enteroviruses (EVs), human rhinoviruses (HRVs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human coronaviruses (HCoVs) OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1, and adenoviruses (ADVs).\n Viral pathogens were detected in 34.6% of patient samples, and 1.6% of the patients tested positive for more than one virus.\n IFVs (19.3%) were the dominant agents detected, followed by HRVs (6.5%), PIVs (4.3%), EVs (3.2%), and HCoVs (1.1%).\n ADVs, RSV and HMPV were also detected (&lt;1%).\n The viral detection rates differed significantly between infections of the lower and upper respiratory

pathogens is causative for respiratory tract infections, but symptoms are mostly similar.\n\n Therefore, the identification of the causative viruses and bacteria is only feasible using multiplex PCR or several monoplex PCR tests in parallel.\n\n\nMethods\nThe analytical sensitivity of three multiplex PCR assays, RespiFinder-19, RespiFinder-SMART-22 and xTAG-Respiratory-Virus-Panel-Fast-Assay (RVP), were compared to monoplex real-time PCR with quantified standardized control material.\n\n All assays include the most common respiratory pathogens.\n\n\nResults\nTo compare the analytical sensitivity of the multiplex assays, samples were inoculated with 13 different quantified viruses in the range of 101 to 105 copies/ml.\n\n Concordant results were received for rhinovirus, whereas the RVP detected influenzavirus, RSV and hMPV more frequently in low concentrations.\n\n The RespiFinder-19 and the RespiFinder-SMART-22 showed a higher analytical sensitivity for adenoviruses and coronaviruses, whereas the RVP was incapable to detect adenovirus and coronavirus in concentrations of 104 copies/ml.\n\n The RespiFinder-19 and RespiFinder-SMART-22A did not detect influenzaviruses (104 copies/ml) and RSV (103 copies/ml).\n\n The detection of all 13 viruses in one sample was only achieved using monoplex PCR.\n\n To analyze possible competitive amplification reactions between the different viruses, samples were further inoculated with only 4 different viruses in one sample.\n\n Compared to the detection of 13 viruses in parallel, only a few differences were found.\n\n\nConclusions\nMultiplex PCR tests have a broad spectrum of pathogens to test at a time.\n\n Analysis of multiple inoculated samples revealed a different focus of the detected virus types by the three assays.\n\n Analysis of clinical samples showed a high concordance of detected viruses by the RespiFinder-19 compared to monoplex tests.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3519643","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mareike","surname":"Dabisch-Ruthe","email":"mdabisch-ruthe@hdz-nrw.de","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Tanja","surname":"Vollmer","email":"tvollmer@hdz-nrw.de","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ortwin","surname":"Adams","email":"Ortwin.Adams@uni-duesseldorf.de","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cornelius","surname":"Knabbe","email":"cknabbe@hdz-nrw.de","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jens","surname":"Dreier","email":"jdreier@hdz-nrw.de","contributions":"2"}],"References":[{"doi":"10.1038/89098","date":"2001-04-30","title":"A

sample and its significance in patients requiring mechanical ventilation remain unknown.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a cohort study in all consecutive adults ventilated for more than 48 hours admitted to a 22-bed medical intensive care unit during a 12-month period.\n\n Respiratory samples at the time of intubation were assessed by culture, by indirect immunofluorescence assay or by molecular methods in systematic tracheobronchial aspirates.\n\n Patients with a virus-negative respiratory sample at the time of intubation were considered unexposed and served as the control group.\n\n\nResults\nForty-five viruses were isolated in 41/187 (22%) patients.\n\n Rhinovirus was the most commonly isolated virus (42%), followed byherpes simplex virus type 1 (22%) and virus influenza A (16%).\n\n In multivariate analysis controlling for the Acute Pathophysiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, patients with respiratory disorder at admission (adjusted odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.8–5.1; P = 0.12), with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma patients (adjusted odds ratio, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.3–6.7; P = 0.01) and with admission between 21 November and 21 March (adjusted odds ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3–5.9; P = 0.008) were independently associated with a virus-positive sample.\n\n Among the 122 patients admitted with respiratory disorder, a tracheobronchial aspirate positive for respiratory viruses at the time of intubation (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.273; 95% confidence interval, 0.096–0.777; P &lt; 0.006) was independently associated with better survival, controlling for the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and admission for cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest.\n\n Among the remaining 65 patients, a virus-positive sample on intubation did not predict survival.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe confirmed the pathogenic role of respiratory viruses in the intensive care unit, particularly rhinovirus.\n\n We suggest, however, that the prognostic value of virus-associated respiratory disorder is better than that of other causes of respiratory

to determine the viral and atypical bacterial causes of different severities and clinical manifestations of ARI in preschool children from low-income families in North-East Brazil.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical/demographic data and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were prospectively collected from children &lt;5 years presenting with ARI over one year to a paediatric A&amp;E department.\n\n Disease severity was grouped according to presence of lower respiratory tract signs, need for hospital admission and need for oxygen.\n\n Clinical manifestation of ARI was based on discharge diagnosis from hospital with four conditions predominating: bronchiolitis, pneumonia, episodic viral wheeze/asthma and upper respiratory tract infection.\n\n Multiplex PCR was used to detect 17 common respiratory viral and atypical bacterial pathogens in NPA.\n\n\nFindings\n407 children with a median age of eight months were recruited.\n\n Pathogens were detected in 85·5% samples with co-infection being particularly common (39·5%).\n\n Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV; 37%), Adenoviruses (AdV; 25%), Rhinoviruses (hRV; 19%), Bocavirus (hBoV; 19%), human Meta-pneumovirus (hMPV; 10%) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mpp; 10%) were most prevalent.\n\n Detection and co-infection rates were similar in all severities and clinical manifestations of ARI apart from RSV, which was associated with more severe disease and specifically more severe cases of bronchiolitis, and Mpp, which was associated with more severe cases of pneumonia.\n\n Mpp was detected in 17% of children admitted to hospital with pneumonia.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThis study underlines the importance of viral and atypical bacterial pathogens in ARI in pre-school children and highlights the complex epidemiology of these pathogens in this age group.\n\n Generally, viruses and atypical bacteria were detected in all severities and clinical manifestations of ARI but RSV and Mpp were associated with more severe cases of bronchiolitis and pneumonia respectively.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3078930","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Patrícia G.

particularly among hospitalized children in resource-limited tropical countries where morbidity and mortality caused by ARIs are highest.\n\n Improved etiological insight is needed to improve clinical management and prevention.\n\n\nObjectives\nWe conducted a three-year prospective descriptive study of severe respiratory illness among children from 2 months to 13 years of age within the largest referral hospital for infectious diseases in southern Vietnam.\n\n\nMethods\nMolecular detection for 15 viral species and subtypes was performed on three types of respiratory specimens (nose, throat swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates) using a multiplex RT-PCR kit (Seeplex™ RV detection, Seegene) and additional monoplex real-time RT-PCRs.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 309 children were enrolled from November 2004 to January 2008. Viruses were identified in 72% (222/309) of cases, including respiratory syncytial virus (24%), influenza virus A and B (17%), human bocavirus (16%), enterovirus (9%), human coronavirus (8%), human metapneumovirus (7%), parainfluenza virus 1–3 (6%), adenovirus (5%), and human rhinovirus A (4%).\n\n Co-infections with multiple viruses were detected in 20% (62/309) of patients.\n\n When combined, diagnostic yields in nose and throat swabs were similar to nasopharyngeal aspirates.\n\n\nConclusion\nSimilar to other parts in the world, RSV and influenza were the predominant viral pathogens detected in Vietnamese hospitalized children.\n\n Combined nasal and throat swabs are the specimens of choice for sensitive molecular detection of a broad panel of viral agents.\n\n Further research is required to better understand the clinical significance of single versus multiple viral coinfections and to address the role of bacterial (co-)infections involved in severe respiratory illness.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3063798","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Anh Ha Lien","surname":"Do","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"H.

severity of respiratory disease: A systematic review","abstract":"Introduction\nThere are suggestions that virus co-infections may influence the clinical outcome of respiratory virus illness.\n\n We performed a systematic review of the literature to summarise the evidence.\n\n\nMethods\nMEDLINE, EMBASE, Ovid and WEB of Science databases, major organisation websites and reference lists of published studies were searched.\n\n The quality of studies was assessed using the STROBE tool (von Elm et al.\n\n, 1) Individual study data was analyzed using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals as a measure of association between exposure (co-infection), patient outcome and results summarised using forest plots and tables\nResults\nNineteen (19) studies from all over the world were identified and included in the review.\n\n Most of the studies 73.7% (14/19) recruited children ?6 years old.\n\n Evidence on the role of co-infection in increasing disease severity was inconclusive.\n\n In five out of eight studies, co-infection significantly increased risk of admission to general ward (OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.3 - 4.4, p = 0.005; OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1 - 7.7, P = 0.04; OR: 3.1, 95% CI: 2.0 - 5.1, p = &lt;0.001; OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.7-3.4, p = &lt;0.0001 and OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1 - 5.1, p = 0.34), one found it did not (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.4 - 0.9, p = 0.02) and the other 2 had insignificant results.\n\n Similarly on risk of admission to ICU, some studies found that co-infection significantly increased risk of admission to ICU (OR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.4 - 5.9, p = 0.004 and OR: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.7 - 5.6, p = &lt;0.0001), whereas others did not (OR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.05 - 0.75, p = 0.02 and OR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.2 - 0.6, p = &lt;0.0001).\n\n There was no evidence for or against respiratory virus co-infections and risk of bronchiolitis or pneumonia.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe influence of co-infections on severe viral respiratory disease is still unclear.\n\n The observed conflict in outcomes could be because they were conducted in different seasons and covered different years and periods.\n\n It could also be due to bias towards the null, especially in studies where only crude

presentations in children, but their role in disease remains uncertain.\n\n The objective of our prospective study was to investigate HCoVs associations with various clinical presentations in hospitalized children up to 6 years of age.\n\n Children hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis (AB), acute gastroenteritis (AGE), or febrile seizures (FS), and children admitted for elective surgical procedures (healthy controls) were included in the study.\n\n In patients with AB, AGE, and FS, a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and blood sample were obtained upon admission and the follow-up visit 14 days later, whereas in children with AGE a stool sample was also acquired upon admission; in healthy controls a NP swab and stool sample were taken upon admission.\n\n Amplification of polymerase 1b gene was used to detect HCoVs in the specimens.\n\n HCoVs-positive specimens were also examined for the presence of several other viruses.\n\n HCoVs were most often detected in children with FS (19/192, 9.9%, 95% CI: 6–15%), followed by children with AGE (19/218, 8.7%, 95% CI: 5.3–13.3%) and AB (20/308, 6.5%, 95% CI: 4.0–9.8%).\n\n The presence of other viruses was a common finding, most frequent in the group of children with AB (19/20, 95%, 95% CI: 75.1–99.8%), followed by FS (10/19, 52.6%, 95% CI: 28.9–75.6%) and AGE (7/19, 36.8%, 95% CI: 16.3–61.6%).\n\n In healthy control children HCoVs were detected in 3/156 (1.9%, 95% CI: 0.4–5.5%) NP swabs and 1/150 (0.7%, 95% CI: 0.02–3.3%) stool samples.\n\n It seems that an etiological role of HCoVs is most likely in children with FS, considering that they had a higher proportion of positive HCoVs results than patients with AB and those with AGE, and had the highest viral load; however, the co-detection of other viruses was 52.6%.\n\n","id":"PMC4865086","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Monika","surname":"Jevšnik","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Andrej","surname":"Steyer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marko","surname":"Pokorn","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tatjana","surname":"Mrvi?","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Štefan","surname":"Grosek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Franc","surname":"Strle","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lara","surname":"Lusa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Miroslav","surname":"Petrovec","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Oliver","surname":"Schildgen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

One S?specific and two N?specific monoclonal antibodies reacted with all of these strains.\n cDNA encompassing the 3? 8.5 kb of the viral RNA genome was isolated by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification had size and restriction endonuclease patterns similar to those of BCV?L9 and BCV?LY138. In contrast, the M gene of HCV?OC43 differed in restriction patterns from HECV?4408 and BCV.\n A genomic deletion located between the S and M within the nonstructural genes of HCV?OC43 was not detected in HECV?4408. DNA sequence analyses of the S and HE genes revealed more than 99% nucleotide and deduced amino acid homologies between HECV?4408 and the virulent wild?type BCV.\n Forty?nine nucleotide and 22 amino acid differences were found between the HE genes of HECV?4408 and HCV?OC43, while only 16 nucleotide and 3 amino acid differences occurred between the HE genes of HECV?4408 and BCVLY138.

for detection of respiratory syncytial virus in respiratory specimens from children","abstract":"Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract morbidity in young children and immunosuppressed patients.\n Objectives: To rapidly and accurately quantify and subtype RSV in respiratory samples, we developed and evaluated two real-time RT-PCR assays.\n Study design: A quantitative assay was designed using primers for a consensus region of the matrix protein gene and a subtype-specific assay for RSV-A and RSV-B detection was designed using primers for the polymerase gene.\n Quantitative RSV RT-PCR results of pediatric nasal wash samples submitted to the University of Washington Virology Laboratory from December 2002, through May 2003, were compared to those of an indirect fluorescent antibody RSV antigen detection assay (FA).\n Results: Specificity of the RT-PCR assay was high, with no amplification of eleven common respiratory viruses and eight herpes viruses.\n Among 751 samples, RSV was detected in 267 (35.6%) by FA and in 286 (38.1%) by RT-PCR.\n Median RSV copy number in nasal wash samples that were positive by both FA and RT-PCR was 2.5×107 copies/mL versus a median of 3.0×104 copies/mL for samples positive by RT-PCR only (P&lt;0.001).\n The detection and quantity of RSV in respiratory specimens was associated with younger age, but not with gender or hospitalization.\n Among positive samples from this Seattle cohort, 52% were subtype A and 48% were subtype B.\n Both subtypes were detected with similar viral loads among all

evaluation of ‘type,’ i.\ne.\n, influenza virus A and B, and ‘subtype,’ i.\ne.\n, H1, H3, and H5, specific, single?step/reaction vessel format, real?time RT?PCR assays using total RNA from archived reference strains, shell?vial cultured and uncultured primary (throat swab/nasal wash) clinical samples.\n The type A and B specific assays detected all 16 influenza type A viruses and both currently circulating influenza B lineages (Yamagata and Victoria), respectively.\n ‘Type’ and ‘subtype’ specific assays utilize one common set of thermocycling conditions, are specific and highly sensitive (detection threshold of approximately 100 target template molecules).\n All clinical specimens and samples were evaluated using both the unconventional portable Ruggedized Advanced Pathogen Identification Device (RAPID) and standard laboratory bench LightCycler instruments.\n These potentially field?deployable assays could offer significant utility for rapid, point of care screening

worldwide in respiratory tract samples from young children by various polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and real-time PCRs (Q-PCR).\n Until now, no data have been reported on the presence of hBoV in Belgium and the detection of hBoV in a multiplex Q-PCR setting has not been described.\n The aim of this study was to develop a fast and reliable multiplex Q-PCR for the simultaneous detection of hBoV DNA and adenovirus (AdV) DNA.\n During the winter of 2004–2005, 445 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were analysed from 404 Belgian children up to 5 years old with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs).\n (Co)infections with hBoV, AdV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and influenza A virus were investigated.\n A viral agent was detected in 61% (n?=?272/445) of the NPAs.\n Multiplex Q-PCR found a prevalence of 11% (n?=?51/445) hBoV and 13% (n?=?58/445) AdV.\n Coinfections were more frequently found with AdV (62%; n?=?36/58) than with hBoV (49%; n?=?25/51).\n Follow-up samples were available from 22 patients with ARTIs.\n In three patients, hBoV DNA persisted for one month.\n Multiplex Q-PCR may help in closing the diagnostic gap by addressing a broader range of potential respiratory pathogens.\n","id":"PMC7087762","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"N.","surname":"De

metapneumoviruses (hMPV) requires molecular methods as viral culture lacks sensitivity.\n\n However, setting up individual PCRs for all respiratory viruses is not practical so preferentially multiplex PCRs are used.\n\n\nObjectives:\nTo develop for routine diagnosis a rapid real-time PCR assay for detection of hRV and hMPV including an internal control in a single tube multiplex reaction using probes carrying different fluorophores to discriminate targets.\n\n\nStudy design:\nThe multiplex real-time RNA PCR was optimized to include the internal control virus and a total of 358 respiratory samples from 239 patients taken over a one-year period were analyzed by the multiplex assay.\n\n\nResults:\nThe multiplex assay with co-amplification of the internal control was as sensitive and specific as the individual assays.\n\n Application of this assay on clinical samples from 239 patients in a one-year period resulted in an incidence of hRV and hMPV of 41/239 (17.1%) and 6/239 (2.5%), respectively.\n\n Inhibition, defined as poor internal control amplification, was detected in 8 (2.2%) samples.\n\n Culture was performed on these samples and only four hRV were

The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection.\n\n These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine.\n\n\nLimitation:\nPublicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThis work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS.\n\n Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.\n\n\nPrimary Funding Source:\nU.\n\nS.\n\n Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of General Medical Sciences, and Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7081172","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Stephen A.","surname":"Lauer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kyra H.","surname":"Grantz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qifang","surname":"Bi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Forrest K.","surname":"Jones","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qulu","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hannah R.","surname":"Meredith","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andrew S.","surname":"Azman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nicholas G.","surname":"Reich","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Justin","surname":"Lessler","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.0110/jama.2020.3204","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiologic features and clinical course of patients with SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1002/mv.25742","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Fecal specimen diagnosis 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.5.2000062","date":"2020-02-06","title":"Incubation period of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections among travellers from Wuhan, China, 20–28 January 2020","abstract":"A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is causing an outbreak of viral pneumonia that started in Wuhan, China.\n Using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases that were detected outside Wuhan in the early outbreak phase, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 6.4 days (95% credible interval: 5.6–7.7), ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile).\n These values should help inform 2019-nCoV case definitions and appropriate quarantine durations.\n","id":"PMC7014672","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jantien A","surname":"Backer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Don","surname":"Klinkenberg","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Don","surname":"Klinkenberg","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jacco","surname":"Wallinga","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Jacco","surname":"Wallinga","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.3227","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Air, surface environmental, and personal perspective equipment contamination by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from a symptomatic patient","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1002/jmv.25975","date":"2020-04-24","title":"Transmission and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in 104 outside?Wuhan patients, China","abstract":"Cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) emigrating from Wuhan escalated the risk of spreading the disease in other cities.\n This report focused on outside?Wuhan patients to assess the transmission and clinical characteristics of this illness.\n Contact investigation was conducted on each patient who was admitted to the assigned hospitals in Hunan Province (geographically adjacent to Wuhan) from 22 January to 23 February 2020.

dynamic profiles of nucleic acid testing results in throat swabs and fecal specimens were closely monitored.\n\n\nResults\nClearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas viral RNA remained detectable in stools of pediatric patients for longer than 4 weeks.\n\n Two children had fecal SARS-CoV-2 undetectable 20 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 8 days.\n\n\nConclusions\nSARS-CoV-2 may exist in children's gastrointestinal tract for a longer time than respiratory system.\n\n Persistent

cases in Spain resulting in more than 20,800 deaths as of April 21, 2020. Faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from COVID-19 patients has extensively been reported.\n Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in six wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) serving the major municipalities within the Region of Murcia (Spain), the area with the lowest COVID-19 prevalence within Iberian Peninsula.\n Firstly, an aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation concentration method was validated using a porcine coronavirus (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, PEDV) and mengovirus (MgV).\n The procedure resulted in average recoveries of 10 ± 3.5% and 10 ± 2.1% in influent water (n = 2) and 3.3 ± 1.6% and 6.2 ± 1.0% in effluent water (n = 2) samples for PEDV and MgV, respectively.\n Then, the method was used to monitor the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 from March 12 to April 14, 2020 in influent, secondary and tertiary effluent water samples.\n By using the real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Diagnostic Panel validated by US CDC that targets three regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene, we estimated quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers in untreated wastewater samples of 5.4 ± 0.2 log10 genomic copies/L on average.\n Two secondary water samples resulted positive (2 out of 18) and all tertiary water samples tested as negative (0 out 12).\n This environmental surveillance data were compared to declared COVID-19 cases at municipality level, revealing that members of the community were shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their stool even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled.\n The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of COVID-19 highlights the relevance of this strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population.\n At this point, this environmental surveillance could be implemented by municipalities right away as a tool, designed to help authorities to coordinate the exit strategy to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown.\n","id":"PMC7229723","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Walter","surname":"Randazzo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pilar","surname":"Truchado","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Enric","surname":"Cuevas-Ferrando","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pedro","surname":"Simón","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ana","surname":"Allende","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gloria","surname":"Sánchez","email":"gloriasanchez@iata.csic.es","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1097/INF.0000000000002729","date":"2020-04-21","title":"Symptomatic

coronavirus disease?2019 (COVID?19).\n The infection due to this virus spread exponentially throughout China and then spread across &gt;205 nations, including the United States (US).\n Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopies are routinely performed in the US and globally.\n Previous reports of isolated infection outbreaks were reported with endoscopes acting as potential vectors.\n While multidrug?resistant organisms have been reported to be spread by endoscopes, few cases of viruses such as hepatitis B and C are noted in the literature.\n COVID?19 is predominately spread by droplet transmission, although recent evidence has showed that shedding in feces and feco?oral transmission could also be possible.\n It is unclear if COVID?19 could be transmitted by endoscopes, but it could theoretically happen due to contact with mucous membranes and body fluids.\n GI endoscopies involve close contact with oral and colonic contents exposing endoscopy staff to respiratory and oropharyngeal secretions.\n This can increase the risk of contamination and contribute to virus transmission.\n Given these risks, all major GI societies have called for rescheduling elective non?urgent procedures and perform only emergent or urgent procedures based on the clinical need.\n Furthermore, pre?screening of all individuals prior to endoscopy is recommended.\n This article focuses on the risk of COVID?19 transmission by GI shedding, the potential role of endoscopes as a vector of this novel virus, including transmission during endoscopies, and prevention strategies including deferral of elective non?urgent endoscopy

infections but their role in gastrointestinal infections is unclear.\n\n The objective of our study was to assess the significance of HCoVs in the etiology of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in children &lt;6?years of age.\n\n\nMethods\nStool samples and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs collected from 260 children hospitalized for AGE (160 also had respiratory symptoms) and 157 otherwise healthy control children admitted for elective surgery were tested for the presence of four HCoVs using real time RT-PCR.\n\n Registered at ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov (reg.\n\n NCT00987519).\n\n\nResults\nHCoVs were more frequent in patients with AGE than in controls (23/260, 8.8% versus 4/151, 2.6%; odds ratio, OR 3.3; 95% confidence interval, CI 1.3–10.0; P?=?0.01).\n\n Three of four HCoV-positive members in the control group, asymptomatic when sampled, recalled gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms within the previous 14?days.\n\n In patients with AGE, HCoVs were present in NP samples more often than in stools (22/256, 8.6%, versus 6/260, 2.3%; P?=?0.0004).\n\n In 5/6 children with HCoVs detected in stools, the viruses were also detected in NP swabs.\n\n Patients had a significantly higher probability of HCoV detection in stool (OR 4; 95% CI 1.4–15.3; P?=?0.006) and also in stool and/or NP (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.3–10.0; P?=?0.01) than healthy controls.\n\n All four HCoVs species were detected in stool and NP samples.\n\n\nConclusions\nAlthough HCoVs were more frequently detected in patients with AGE than in the control group, high prevalence of HCoVs in NP swabs compounded by their low occurrence in stool samples and detection of other viruses in stool samples, indicate that HCoVs probably play only a minor role in causing gastrointestinal illness in children &lt;6?years

lower respiratory tract morbidity in young children and immunosuppressed patients.\n Objectives: To rapidly and accurately quantify and subtype RSV in respiratory samples, we developed and evaluated two real-time RT-PCR assays.\n Study design: A quantitative assay was designed using primers for a consensus region of the matrix protein gene and a subtype-specific assay for RSV-A and RSV-B detection was designed using primers for the polymerase gene.\n Quantitative RSV RT-PCR results of pediatric nasal wash samples submitted to the University of Washington Virology Laboratory from December 2002, through May 2003, were compared to those of an indirect fluorescent antibody RSV antigen detection assay (FA).\n Results: Specificity of the RT-PCR assay was high, with no amplification of eleven common respiratory viruses and eight herpes viruses.\n Among 751 samples, RSV was detected in 267 (35.6%) by FA and in 286 (38.1%) by RT-PCR.\n Median RSV copy number in nasal wash samples that were positive by both FA and RT-PCR was 2.5×107 copies/mL versus a median of 3.0×104 copies/mL for samples positive by RT-PCR only (P&lt;0.001).\n The detection and quantity of RSV in respiratory specimens was associated with younger age, but not with gender or hospitalization.\n Among positive samples from this Seattle cohort, 52% were subtype A and 48% were subtype B.\n Both subtypes were detected with similar viral loads among all patient groups (stratified by age, gender, and hospitalization), and throughout the specimen collection period.\n Conclusions: These real-time RT-PCR assays provide a rapid, specific, and highly sensitive alternative for detecting, quantifying, and subtyping RSV in clinical

Influenza B were detected in 13.9% (n = 54), 5.1% (n = 20), 2.6% (n = 10), and 1.8% (n = 7), respectively.\n\n There was no influenza A DNA detected in any of the specimens.\n\n The clinical diagnoses were acute wheezing (bronchitis) in four patients, radiologically confirmed pneumonia in six patients (55%) and croup syndrome in one patient.\n\n In five to six patients with pneumonia, HBoV was the only pathogen detected.\n\n While no patient had to be mechanically ventilated, 73% needed oxygen supplementation.\n\n In four (36.4%) patients at least one other viral pathogen was found (plus RSV n = 3; 27.3%; Norovirus n = 1; 9.1%).\n\n\nConclusion\nHBoV causes severe respiratory tract infections in infants and young children.\n\n Its role as a copathogen and many other open questions has to be defined in further prospective studies.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7185401","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sebastian","surname":"Völz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Oliver","surname":"Schildgen","email":"schildgen@mibi03.meb.uni-bonn.de","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dennis","surname":"Klinkenberg","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vanessa","surname":"Ditt","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andreas","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ramona

investigation","abstract":"Sensitive, rapid detection of respiratory viruses is needed for surveillance and for investigation of epidemiologically linked cases.\n The utility of rapid antigen-based methods for detection of common respiratory viruses and to confirm the cause of outbreaks is well established.\n However, nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs) offer some benefits above antigen or culture-based procedures, with the main advantages being sensitivity and range of pathogens detectable.\n It is important to understand how changes in our testing methodology alter respiratory virus detection and information for epidemiological studies.\n For viruses such as influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus, NATs offer enhanced sensitivity above antigen assays but still identify the seasonal peaks important for predicting disease and managing time-sensitive prophylaxis.\n For other viruses, such as rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, human bocavirus and parainfluenza virus type 4, culture and antigen-based procedures are not available and/or lack sensitivity.\n Thus such targets would be missed if NATs were not included in testing for surveillance and outbreak investigation.\n As more respiratory viruses are identified there is a need to expand surveillance and further evaluate new technologies and automation beyond currently-available diagnostics to address detection of a broad range of potential pathogens.\n","id":"PMC7128565","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Julie

with respiratory tract infections by an internally controlled multiplex real-time RNA PCR","abstract":"Background:\nAdequate laboratory diagnosis of human rhinoviruses (hRV) and human metapneumoviruses (hMPV) requires molecular methods as viral culture lacks sensitivity.\n\n However, setting up individual PCRs for all respiratory viruses is not practical so preferentially multiplex PCRs are used.\n\n\nObjectives:\nTo develop for routine diagnosis a rapid real-time PCR assay for detection of hRV and hMPV including an internal control in a single tube multiplex reaction using probes carrying different fluorophores to discriminate targets.\n\n\nStudy design:\nThe multiplex real-time RNA PCR was optimized to include the internal control virus and a total of 358 respiratory samples from 239 patients taken over a one-year period were analyzed by the multiplex assay.\n\n\nResults:\nThe multiplex assay with co-amplification of the internal control was as sensitive and specific as the individual assays.\n\n Application of this assay on clinical samples from 239 patients in a one-year period resulted in an incidence of hRV and hMPV of 41/239 (17.1%) and 6/239 (2.5%), respectively.\n\n Inhibition, defined as poor internal control amplification, was detected in 8 (2.2%) samples.\n\n Culture was performed on these samples and only four hRV were detected.\n\n\nConclusions:\nThis real-time PCR method enables sensitive diagnosis of these two respiratory pathogens with the potential to expand the assay as part of a full molecular respiratory viral screen.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7185544","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"S.A.","surname":"Scheltinga","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"K.E.","surname":"Templeton","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"M.F.C.","surname":"Beersma","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"E.C.J.","surname":"Claas","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"}],"References":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Frequency

Infection: Quasispecies Nature of the Persisting MHV RNA","abstract":"Coronavirus infection of mice has been used extensively as a model for the study of acute encephalitis and chronic demyelination.\n To examine the evolution of coronavirus RNA during chronic demyelinating infection, we isolated RNA from intracerebrally inoculated mice at 4, 6, 8, 13, 20, and 42 days postinfection and used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification methods (RT-PCR) to detect viral sequences.\n RNA sequences from two viral structural genes, the spike gene and the nucleocapsid gene, were detected throughout the chronic infection.\n In contrast, infectious virus was not detectable from brain homongenates beyond 13 days postinfection.\n These results indicate that coronavirus RNA persists in the brain at times when infectious virus is not detected.\n To determine if genetic changes were occurring during viral replication in the host, we cloned and sequenced the RT-PCR products from the spike and nucleocapsid regions and analyzed the sequences for mutations.\n Sequencing of the cloned products revealed that a variety of mutant forms of viral RNA persisted in the CNS, including point mutants, deletion mutants, and termination mutants.\n The mutations accumulated during persistent infection in both the spike and the nucleocapsid sequences, with greater than 65% of the mutations encoding amino acid changes.\n These results show that a diverse population or quasispecies consisting of mutant and deletion variant viral RNAs (which may not be capable of producing infectious virus particles) persists in the central nervous system of mice during chronic demyelinating infection.\n The implications of these results for the role of persistent viral genetic information in the pathogenesis of chronic demyelination are discussed.\n","id":"PMC7131440","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cecilia","surname":"Adami","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joan","surname":"Pooley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Juliet","surname":"Glomb","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Stecker","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fabeha","surname":"Fazal","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"John

These genes differ distinctly among the three coronavirus groups and are specific for each group.\n While the essential genes encode replication and structural functions, hardly anything is known about the products and functions of the group-specific genes.\n As a first step to elucidate their significance, we deleted the group-specific genes from the group 2 mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genome via a novel targeted recombination system based on host switching (L.\n Kuo, G.\n J.\nGodeke, M.\n J.\n Raamsman, P.\n S.\n Masters, and P.\n J.\n M.\n Rottier, 2000, J.\n Virol.\n 74, 1393–1406).\n Thus, we obtained recombinant viruses from which the two clusters of group-specific genes were deleted either separately or in combination in a controlled genetic background.\n As all recombinant deletion mutant viruses appeared to be viable, we conclude that the MHV group-specific genes are nonessential, accessory genes.\n Importantly, all deletion mutant viruses were attenuated when inoculated into their natural host, the mouse.\n Therefore, deletion of the coronavirus group-specific genes seems to provide an attractive approach to generate attenuated live coronavirus

known.\n A complete cDNA clone of a mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) DI RNA, NE-1, containing a single nucleotide deletion in the 5? region of the ORF was obtained and analyzed.\n Due to this single nucleotide deletion, a DI-specific protein of 7.5-kDa was made from NE-1, in contrast to the 88-kDa protein made from the wild-type DI RNA.\n NE-1 RNA was efficiently replicated after transfection into MHV-infected cells.\n However, after one passage of NE-1 RNA-containing virus, the 88-kDa wild-type protein was synthesized, indicating that the large ORF was restored during NE-1 DI RNA replication.\n Sequence analysis of NE-1 DI RNA from infected cells demonstrated that in approximately half of the DI RNA population, the ORF was restored by RNA recombination between NE-1 DI RNA and helper virus genomic sequence.\n The sequences of other DI RNAs contained an additional nontemplated A? at the five-A? sequence nine nucleotides upstream of the deletion site, resulting in a stretch of six consecutive A? s.\n In these 'edited'-type DI RNAs, the original nucleotide deletion was maintained and no RNA recombination was observed.\n This 'editing' produced an ORF of the same size as the wild-type DI RNA.\n We conclude that the DI RNA with a large ORF has a selective advantage.\n There was no significant difference in replication efficiency among these RNAs when they replicated alone.\n However, cotransfection of two DI RNA species and time course experiments suggested that homologous interference and other mechanism(s) during the early stage of virus multiplication are responsible for the accumulation of DI RNAs containing the large

demyelination and only at very high levels of virus inoculation.\n Thus acute encephalitis is not sufficient for the induction of demyelination by MHV-A59. Analysis of mutants isolated at earlier times from the same persistently infected glial cell culture as C12, as well as mutants isolated from a second independent culture of persistently infected glial cells, suggests that both the weakly demyelinating and the weakly hepatotropic phenotypes of C12 are associated with the Q159L amino acid substitution.\n","id":"PMC7131600","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Isabelle","surname":"Leparc-Goffart","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Susan T.","surname":"Hingley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ming Ming","surname":"Chua","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xinhe","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ehud","surname":"Lavi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Susan R.","surname":"Weiss","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/0092-8674(86)90492-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Deletion mapping of Sindbis virus DI RNAs derived from cDNAs defines the sequences essential for replication and packaging","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein binds to the leader RNA of mouse hepatitis virus and serves as a regulator of viral transcription","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1073/pnas.94.18.9544","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 binds to the transcription-regulatory region of mouse hepatitis virus RNA","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Mutational analysis of the promoter required for influenza virus virion RNA synthesis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1006/viro.1995.1275","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A <italic>cis</italic>-Acting Viral Protein Is Not Required for the Replication of a Coronavirus Defective-Interfering RNA","abstract":"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus, generates defective-interfering (DI) RNAs of different sizes during passages at high multiplicities of infection.\n All MHV DI RNAs characterized so far contain an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a fused viral protein;

density in linear sucrose gradients of 1.17-1.18 g/cm3 and contain approximately 4% RNA by weight.\n The genomic ribonucleic acid of IBV shows the following characteristic: (1) It consists of one size class of single-stranded RNA having a molecular weight of 5.5-5.7 x 108 and a sedimentation coefficient of about 48 S; (2) no evidence for subunit structure is apparent since the RNA resolves as a single species with the same electrophoretic mobility in polyacrylamide gels before and after heat denaturation; (3) at least 20–30% of the RNA molecules extracted from purified virions contain sequences of polyadenylic acid of approximately 4 S size; (4) RNA obtained from detergent-disrupted virus particles by phenol-chloroform extraction is infectious for cultures of chick embryo fibroblasts, giving rise to progeny virus which is lethal for embryonated eggs.\n These findings, together with the observation that IBV virions do not exhibit detectable transcriptase activity, support the conclusion that the genome of this coronavirus acts directly as a messenger RNA in eukaryotic cells.\n","id":"PMC7130683","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gerald","surname":"Schochetman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Roy

infectious bronchitis virus genome<","abstract":"Previous studies on infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) cDNA have identified a region of about 184 bases in the 3' non-coding terminus of both the U.\nS.\n prototype strain (Beaudette) and a Japanese strain (KB8523), that was not present in an antigenically closely related U.\nS.\n strain, Massachusetts (Mass) 41 (Boursnell et al.\n, 1985; Sutou et al.\n, 1988).\n In order to investigate the origin and function of this region and its occurrence in nature, the cDNA sequences of the 3' non-coding regions of three additional strains of IBV, Gray, Arkansas (Ark) 99 and Holland (Holl) 52, were determined and compared to the sequences of the Beaudette, KB8523 and Mass41 strains.\n Not only was this U-rich sequence absent from the 3' non-coding region of the Mass41 strain, it was also highly variable, especially in comparison to the highly conserved 3' non coding region downstream of this sequence.\n Computer analyses of the sequences adjacent to this hypervariable region (HVR) showed that the 3' end of the IBV genome was highly conserved downstream of this region, with 94.3 to 97.8% similarity.\n However, the similarities for the HVR ranged from 53.2% between Ho1152 and Ark99, to 92.8% between Beaudette and Gray.\n The flanking sequences were not only conserved but these sequences upstream and downstream of the HVR also formed mirrored images.\n","id":"PMC7134043","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"A.K.","surname":"Williams","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"L.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"L.W.","surname":"Sneed","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"E.W.","surname":"Collisson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A

UTR sequences on the coronavirus genome are known to carry cis-acting elements for DI RNA replication and presumably also virus genome replication.\n 5? UTR-adjacent coding sequences are also thought to harbor cis-acting elements.\n Here we have determined the 5? UTR and adjacent 289-nt sequences, and 3? UTR sequences, for six group 2 coronaviruses and have compared them to each other and to three previously reported group 2 members.\n Extensive regions of highly similar UTR sequences were found but small regions of divergence were also found indicating group 2 coronaviruses could be subdivided into those that are bovine coronavirus (BCoV)-like (BCoV, human respiratory coronavirus-OC43, human enteric coronavirus, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, and equine coronavirus) and those that are murine hepatitis virus (MHV)-like (A59, 2, and JHM strains of MHV, puffinosis virus, and rat sialodacryoadenitis virus).\n The 3? UTRs of BCoV and MHV have been previously shown to be interchangeable.\n Here, a reporter-containing BCoV DI RNA was shown to be replicated by all five BCoV-like helper viruses and by MHV-H2 (a human cell-adapted MHV strain), a representative of the MHV-like subgroup, demonstrating group 2 common 5? and 3? replication signaling elements.\n BCoV DI RNA, furthermore, acquired the leader of HCoV-OC43 by leader switching, demonstrating for the first time in vivo recombination between animal and human coronavirus molecules.\n These results indicate that common replication signaling elements exist among group 2 coronaviruses despite a two-cluster pattern within the group and imply there could exist a high potential for recombination among group members.\n","id":"PMC7126556","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hung-Yi","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"James S","surname":"Guy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dongwan","surname":"Yoo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Reinhard","surname":"Vlasak","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ena","surname":"Urbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David A","surname":"Brian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Full-length genomic sequence of bovine coronavirus (31 kb)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1074/jbc.M010923200","date":"1970-01-01","title":"In vitro RNA synthesis from exogenous dengue viral RNA templates requires long range interactions between 5'-and 3'-terminal regions that influence RNA structure","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.74.22.10600-10611.2000","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Strategy for systematic assembly of large RNA and DNA genomes: the transmissible gastroenteritis virus model","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.76.21.11065-11078.2002","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Systematic assembly of a full-length infectious cDNA of mouse hepatitis virus strain A59","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Specific binding of host cellular proteins to multiple sites within the 3' end of mouse hepatitis virus genomic RNA","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A 5'-proximal RNA sequence of murine coronavirus as a potential initiation site for genomic-length mRNA transcription","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1006/viro.1993.1465","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Presence of Subgenomic mRNAs in Virions of Coronavirus IBV","abstract":"The presence of subgenomic mRNAs in virions of IBV was examined by probing Northern blots of RNA extracted from virions using as a probe a cDNA of the 3?-terminal nucleocapsid protein (N) gene.\n This detects all five mRNAs because of the 3?-coterminal, nested-set arrangement of coronavirus mRNAs.\n The mRNAs were readily detected even after extensive purification of virions and after RNase A treatment of virions.\n In sucrose gradients the peaks of virus particles, genomic RNA (gRNA), and mRNAs were coincident.\n Cellular mRNA was not detected in virions.\n The molar ratio of gRNA to each mRNA ranged from about 10 to 30 for IBV-Beaudette and 25 to 800 for IBV-M41.

practical so preferentially multiplex PCRs are used.\n\n\nObjectives:\nTo develop for routine diagnosis a rapid real-time PCR assay for detection of hRV and hMPV including an internal control in a single tube multiplex reaction using probes carrying different fluorophores to discriminate targets.\n\n\nStudy design:\nThe multiplex real-time RNA PCR was optimized to include the internal control virus and a total of 358 respiratory samples from 239 patients taken over a one-year period were analyzed by the multiplex assay.\n\n\nResults:\nThe multiplex assay with co-amplification of the internal control was as sensitive and specific as the individual assays.\n\n Application of this assay on clinical samples from 239 patients in a one-year period resulted in an incidence of hRV and

retrospective descriptive study of weekly laboratory-confirmed RSV detections between weeks 40/2010 and 20/2016, in patients investigated for influenza-like illness, acute respiratory infection or following the clinician’s judgment.\n\n Six countries reported 4,230 sentinel RSV laboratory diagnoses from primary care and 14 countries reported 156,188 non-sentinel laboratory diagnoses from primary care or hospitals.\n\n The median length of the RSV season based on sentinel and non-sentinel surveillance was 16 (range: 9–24) and 18 (range: 8–24) weeks, respectively.\n\n The median peak

(RSV) remains unknown.\n\n We aimed to estimate the global incidence of and mortality from episodes of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) due to RSV in children younger than 5 years in 2005.\nMethods\nWe estimated the incidence of RSV-associated ALRI in children younger than 5 years, stratified by age, using data from a systematic review of studies published between January, 1995, and June, 2009, and ten unpublished population-based studies.\n\n We estimated possible boundaries for RSV-associated ALRI mortality by combining case fatality ratios with incidence estimates from hospital-based reports from published and unpublished studies and identifying studies with population-based data for RSV seasonality and monthly ALRI mortality.\n\n\nFindings\nIn 2005, an estimated 33·8 (95% CI 19·3–46·2) million new episodes of RSV-associated ALRI occurred worldwide in children younger than 5 years (22% of ALRI episodes), with at least 3·4 (2·8–4·3) million episodes representing severe RSV-associated ALRI necessitating hospital admission.\n\n We estimated that 66?000–199?000 children younger than 5 years died from RSV-associated ALRI in 2005, with 99% of these deaths occurring in developing countries.\n\n Incidence and mortality can vary substantially from year to year in any one setting.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGlobally, RSV is the most common cause of childhood ALRI and a major cause of admission to hospital as a result of severe ALRI.\n\n Mortality data suggest that RSV is an important cause of death in childhood from ALRI, after pneumococcal pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae type b.\n\n The development of novel prevention and treatment strategies should be accelerated as a priority.\n\n\nFunding\nWHO; Bill &amp; Melinda Gates

Systematic review and meta?analysis","abstract":"Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major public health burden worldwide.\n We aimed to review the current literature on the incidence and mortality of severe RSV in children globally.\n Methods: Systematic literature review and meta?analysis of published data from 2000 onwards, reporting on burden of acute respiratory infection (ARI) due to RSV in children.\n Main outcomes were hospitalization for severe RSV?ARI and death.\n Results: Five thousand two hundred and seventy?four references were identified.\n Fifty?five studies were included from 32 countries.\n The global RSV?ARI hospitalization estimates, reported per 1,000 children per year (95% Credible Interval (CrI), were 4.37 (2.98, 6.42) among children &lt;5 years, 19.19 (15.04, 24.48) among children &lt;1 year, 20.01 (9.65, 41.31) among children &lt;6 months and 63.85 (37.52, 109.70) among premature children &lt;1 year.\n The RSV?ARI global case?fatality estimates, reported per 1,000 children, (95% Crl) were 6.21 (2.64, 13.73) among children &lt;5 years, 6.60 (1.85, 16.93) for children &lt;1 year, and 1.04 (0.17, 12.06) among preterm children &lt;1 year.\n Conclusions: A substantial proportion of RSV?associated morbidity occurs in the first year of life, especially in children born prematurely.\n These data affirm the importance of RSV disease in the causation of hospitalization and as a significant contributor to pediatric mortality and further demonstrate gestational age as a critical determinant of disease severity.\n An important limitation of case?fatality ratios is the absence of individual patient characteristics of non?surviving patients.\n Moreover, case?fatality ratios cannot be translated to population?based

lower respiratory infections due to respiratory syncytial virus in young children in 2015: a systematic review and modelling study","abstract":"Background\nWe have previously estimated that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was associated with 22% of all episodes of (severe) acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) resulting in 55?000 to 199?000 deaths in children younger than 5 years in 2005. In the past 5 years, major research activity on RSV has yielded substantial new data from developing countries.\n\n With a considerably expanded dataset from a large international collaboration, we aimed to estimate the global incidence, hospital admission rate, and mortality from RSV-ALRI episodes in young children in 2015.\nMethods\nWe estimated the incidence and hospital admission rate of RSV-associated ALRI (RSV-ALRI) in children younger than 5 years stratified by age and World Bank income regions from a systematic review of studies published between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2016, and unpublished data from 76 high quality population-based studies.\n\n We estimated the RSV-ALRI incidence for 132 developing countries using a risk factor-based model and 2015 population estimates.\n\n We estimated the in-hospital RSV-ALRI mortality by combining in-hospital case fatality ratios with hospital admission estimates from hospital-based (published and unpublished) studies.\n\n We also estimated overall RSV-ALRI mortality by identifying studies reporting monthly data for ALRI mortality in the community and RSV activity.\n\n\nFindings\nWe estimated that globally in 2015, 33·1 million (uncertainty range [UR] 21·6–50·3) episodes of RSV-ALRI, resulted in about 3·2 million (2·7–3·8) hospital admissions, and 59?600 (48?000–74?500) in-hospital deaths in children younger than 5 years.\n\n In children younger than 6 months, 1·4 million (UR 1·2–1·7) hospital admissions, and 27?300 (UR 20?700–36?200) in-hospital deaths were due to RSV-ALRI.\n\n We also estimated that the overall RSV-ALRI mortality could be as high as 118?200 (UR 94?600–149?400).\n\n Incidence and mortality varied substantially from year to year in any given population.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGlobally, RSV is a common cause of childhood ALRI and a major cause of hospital admissions in young children, resulting in a substantial burden on health-care services.\n\n About 45% of hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths due to RSV-ALRI occur in children younger than 6 months.\n\n An effective maternal RSV vaccine or monoclonal antibody could have a substantial effect on disease burden in this age group.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Bill &amp; Melinda Gates

analysis","abstract":"Background\nid='P3'>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of acute\nlower respiratory infection in young children.\n\n We previously estimated that\nin 2015, 33·1 million episodes of RSV-associated acute lower\nrespiratory infection occurred in children aged 0–60 months,\nresulting in a total of 118 200 deaths worldwide.\n\n Since then, several\ncommunity surveillance studies have been done to obtain a more precise\nestimation of RSV associated community deaths.\n\n We aimed to update\nRSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection morbidity and mortality at\nglobal, regional, and national levels in children aged 0–60 months\nfor 2019, with focus on overall mortality and narrower infant age groups\nthat are targeted by RSV prophylactics in development.\n\n\nMethods\nid='P4'>In this systematic analysis, we expanded our global RSV disease\nburden dataset by obtaining new data from an updated search for papers\npublished between Jan 1, 2017, and Dec 31, 2020, from MEDLINE, Embase,\nGlobal Health, CINAHL, Web of Science, LILACS, OpenGrey, CNKI, Wanfang, and\nChongqingVIP.\n\n We also included unpublished data from RSV GEN collaborators.\n\n\nEligible studies reported data for children aged 0–60 months with RSV\nas primary infection with acute lower respiratory infection in community\nsettings, or acute lower respiratory infection necessitating hospital\nadmission; reported data for at least 12 consecutive months, except for\nin-hospital case fatality ratio (CFR) or for where RSV seasonality is\nwell-defined; and reported incidence rate, hospital admission rate, RSV\npositive proportion in acute lower respiratory infection hospital admission,\nor in-hospital CFR.\n\n Studies were excluded if case definition was not clearly\ndefined or not consistently applied, RSV infection was not laboratory\nconfirmed or based on serology alone, or if the report included fewer than\n50 cases of acute lower respiratory infection.\n\n We applied a generalised\nlinear mixed-effects model (GLMM) to estimate RSV-associated acute lower\nrespiratory infection incidence, hospital admission, and in-hospital\nmortality both globally and regionally (by country development status and by\nWorld Bank Income Classification) in 2019. We estimated country-level\nRSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection incidence through a\nrisk-factor based model.\n\n We developed new models (through GLMM) that\nincorporated the latest RSV community mortality data for estimating overall\nRSV mortality.\n\n This review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021252400).\n\n\nFindings\nid='P5'>In addition to 317 studies included in our previous review, we\nidentified and included 113 new eligible studies and unpublished data from\n51 studies, for a total of 481 studies.\n\n We estimated that globally in 2019,\nthere were 33·0 million RSV-associated acute lower respiratory\ninfection episodes (uncertainty range [UR] 25·4–44·6\nmillion), 3·6 million RSV-associated acute lower respiratory\ninfection hospital admissions (2·9–4·6 million), 26 300\nRSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection in-hospital deaths (15\n100–49 100), and 101 400 RSV-attributable overall deaths (84\n500–125 200) in children aged 0–60 months.\n\n In infants aged\n0–6 months, we estimated that there were 6·6 million\nRSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection episodes\n(4·6–9·7 million), 1·4 million RSV-associated\nacute lower respiratory infection hospital admissions\n(1·0–2·0 million), 13 300 RSV-associated acute lower\nrespiratory infection inhospital deaths (6800–28 100), and 45700\nRSV-attributable overall deaths (38 400–55 900).\n\n 2·0% of\ndeaths in children aged 0–60 months (UR 1·6–2·4)\nand 3·6% of deaths in children aged 28 days to 6 months\n(3·0–4·4) were attributable to RSV.\n\n More than 95% of\nRSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection episodes and more than 97%\nof RSV-attributable deaths across all age bands were in low-income and\nmiddle-income countries (LMICs).\n\n\nInterpretation\nid='P6'>RSV contributes substantially to morbidity and mortality burden\nglobally in children aged 0–60 months, especially during the first 6\nmonths of life and in LMICs.\n\n We highlight the striking overall mortality\nburden of RSV disease worldwide, with one in every 50 deaths in children\naged 0–60 months and one in every 28 deaths in children aged 28 days\nto 6 months attributable to RSV.\n\n For every RSV-associated acute lower\nrespiratory infection in-hospital death, we estimate approximately three\nmore deaths attributable to RSV in the community.\n\n RSV passive immunisation\nprogrammes targeting protection during the first 6 months of life could have\na substantial effect on reducing RSV disease burden, although more data are\nneeded to understand the implications of the potential age-shifts in peak\nRSV burden to older age when these are implemented.\n\n\nFunding\nid='P7'>EU Innovative Medicines Initiative Respiratory Syncytial Virus\nConsortium in Europe

attributable to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains unknown.\n\n We aimed to estimate the global incidence of and mortality from episodes of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) due to RSV in children younger than 5 years in 2005.\nMethods\nWe estimated the incidence of RSV-associated ALRI in children younger than 5 years, stratified by age, using data from a systematic review of studies published between January, 1995, and June, 2009, and ten unpublished population-based studies.\n\n We estimated possible boundaries for RSV-associated ALRI mortality by combining case fatality ratios with incidence estimates from hospital-based reports from published and unpublished studies and identifying studies with population-based data for RSV seasonality and monthly ALRI mortality.\n\n\nFindings\nIn 2005, an estimated 33·8 (95% CI 19·3–46·2) million new episodes of RSV-associated ALRI occurred worldwide in children younger than 5 years (22% of ALRI episodes), with at least 3·4 (2·8–4·3) million episodes representing severe RSV-associated ALRI necessitating hospital admission.\n\n We estimated that 66?000–199?000 children younger than 5 years died from RSV-associated ALRI in 2005, with 99% of these deaths occurring in developing countries.\n\n Incidence and mortality can vary substantially from year to year in any one setting.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGlobally, RSV is the most common cause of childhood ALRI and a major cause of admission to hospital as a result of severe ALRI.\n\n Mortality data suggest that RSV is an important cause of death in childhood from ALRI, after pneumococcal pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae type b.\n\n The development of novel prevention and treatment strategies should be accelerated as a priority.\n\n\nFunding\nWHO; Bill &amp; Melinda Gates

3328 articles through 14 August 2020 and identified 25 studies with 31 unique estimates of RSV-associated hospitalization rates.\n\n Among US infants &lt;1 year of age, annual rates ranged from 8.4 to

Taskforce of 24 RSV worldwide experts assessed key needs for RSV prevention in LMICs, including vaccine and newer preventive measures.\n\n\nMethods\nA global, survey-based study was undertaken in 2021. An online questionnaire was developed following three meetings of the Taskforce panellists wherein factors related to RSV infection, its prevention and management were identified using iterative questioning.\n\n Each factor was scored, by non-panellists interested in RSV, on a scale of zero (very-low-relevance) to 100 (very-high-relevance) within two scenarios: (1) Current and (2) Future expectations for RSV management.\n\n\nResults\nNinety questionnaires were completed: 70 by respondents (71.4% physicians; 27.1% researchers/scientists) from 16 LMICs and 20 from nine high-income (HI) countries (90.0% physicians; 5.0% researchers/scientists), as a reference group.\n\n Within LMICs, RSV awareness was perceived to be low, and management was not prioritised.\n\n Of the 100 factors scored, those related to improved diagnosis particularly access to affordable point-of-care diagnostics, disease burden data generation, clinical and general education, prompt access to new interventions, and engagement with policymakers/payers were identified of paramount importance.\n\n There was a strong need for clinical education and local data generation in the lowest economies, whereas upper-middle income countries were more closely aligned with HI countries in terms of current RSV service provision.\n\n\nConclusion\nSeven key actions for improving RSV prevention and management in LMICs are proposed.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9682277","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xavier","surname":"Carbonell-Estrany","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eric A.

study","abstract":"Background\nSeasonal epidemics of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cause a clinically significant burden of disease among young children.\n\n Non-pharmaceutical interventions targeted at SARS-CoV-2 have affected the activity of other respiratory pathogens.\n\n We describe changes in the epidemiology of RSV among children younger than 5 years in England since 2020.\nMethods\nSurveillance data on RSV infections, comprising laboratory-confirmed cases, proportion of positive tests, hospital admissions for RSV-attributable illness, and syndromic indicators for RSV-associated disease (emergency department attendances for acute bronchitis or bronchiolitis, non-emergency health advice telephone service [NHS 111] calls for cough, general practitioner [GP] in-hours consultations for respiratory tract infections, and GP out-of-hours contacts for acute bronchitis or bronchiolitis) were analysed from Dec 29, 2014 to March 13, 2022, for children younger than 5 years.\n\n Data were extracted from national laboratory, clinical, and syndromic surveillance systems.\n\n Time-series analyses using generalised linear models were used to estimate the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions targeting SARS-CoV-2 on RSV indicators, with absolute and relative changes calculated by comparing observed and predicted values.\n\n\nFindings\nRSV-associated activity was reduced for all RSV indicators during winter 2020–21 in England, with 10?280 (relative change –99·5% [95% prediction interval –100·0 to –99·1]) fewer laboratory-confirmed cases, 22·2 (–99·6%) percentage points lower test positivity, 92?530 (–80·8% [–80·9 to –80·8]) fewer hospital admissions, 96?672 (–73·7% [–73·7 to –73·7]) fewer NHS 111 calls, 2924 (–88·8% [–90·4 to –87·2]) fewer out-of-hours GP contacts, 91?304 (–89·9% [–90·0 to –89·9]) in-hours GP consultations, and 27?486 (–85·3% [–85·4 to –85·2]) fewer emergency department attendances for children younger than 5 years compared with predicted values based on winter seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n An unprecedented summer surge of RSV activity occurred in 2021, including 11?255 (1258·3% [1178·3 to 1345·8]) extra laboratory-confirmed cases, 11·6 percentage points (527·3%) higher test positivity, 7604 (10·7% [10·7 to 10·8]) additional hospital admissions, 84?425 (124·8% [124·7 to 124·9]) more calls to NHS 111, 409 (39·0% [36·6 to 41·8]) more out-of-hours GP contacts, and 9789 (84·9% [84·5 to 85·4]) more emergency department attendances compared with the predicted values, although there were 21?805 (–34·1% [–34·1 to –34·0]) fewer in-hours GP consultations than expected.\n\n Most indicators were also lower than expected in winter 2021–22, although to a lesser extent than in winter 2020–21.\nInterpretation\nThe extraordinary absence of RSV during winter 2020–21 probably resulted in a cohort of young children without natural immunity to RSV, thereby raising the potential for increased RSV incidence, out-of-season activity, and health-service pressures when measures to restrict SARS-CoV-2 transmission were relaxed.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9762748","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Megan","surname":"Bardsley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Roger

variations in seasonality of laboratory-confirmed influenza and RSV epidemics in 137 global locations based on literature review and electronic sources.\n\n We assessed peak timing and epidemic duration and explored their association with geography and study settings.\n\n We fitted time series model to weekly national data available from the WHO influenza surveillance system (FluNet) to further characterize seasonal parameters.\n\n\nResults\nInfluenza and RSV activity consistently peaked during winter months in temperate locales, while there was greater diversity in the tropics.\n\n Several temperate locations experienced semi-annual influenza activity with peaks occurring in winter and summer.\n\n Semi-annual activity was relatively common in tropical areas of Southeast Asia for both viruses.\n\n Biennial cycles of RSV activity were identified in Northern Europe.\n\n Both viruses exhibited weak latitudinal gradients in the timing of epidemics by hemisphere, with peak timing

epidemiological study","abstract":"Background\nSeasonal RSV infections occur every year and affect particularly children under six months of age.\n\n Passive immunoprophylaxis with monoclonal antibody Palivizumab is recommended in the period with high risk of RSV infection.\n\n This study aims to define the period for the southern part of Germany (Stuttgart area).\n\n\nMethods\nEpidemiological analysis of the RSV situation in southern Germany from 1996 to 2004 and comparison of results with literature was made.\n\n The respiratory tract specimens were sent in for the detection of RSV mainly by paediatric clinics.\n\n Detection of RSV was carried out mainly by real-time RT-PCR or by ELISA 'Pathfinder'.\n\n RSV outbreaks were depicted as an absolute number and as a percentage of RSV diagnoses in a month.\n\n Onsets, offsets, peaks, duration and severity of RSV seasons were defined and analysed.\n\n\nResults\nAn early season with strong RSV activity (early-high phase) was followed by a weaker late season (late-low phase) in a regular biennial rhythm.\n\n However, onsets, offsets and durations of outbreaks varied significantly from year to year.\n\n RSV epidemics in southern Germany were found to oscillate in an antiphase with RSV epidemics in Finland and Sweden.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe long-term regular biennial rhythm allows predicting whether the next outbreak will be late or early and whether RSV activity will be strong or weak.\n\n Not foreseeable, however, is the precise time of increase and decrease of RSV activity.\n\n Moreover, the regular seasonal pattern may be disrupted by irregular outbreaks.\n\n Thus, activity of RSV has to be monitored every year to define the period with high risk of infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1084247","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Elena","surname":"Terletskaia-Ladwig","email":"ladwig@labor-enders.de","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gisela","surname":"Enders","email":"enders@labor-enders.de","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gunnar","surname":"Schalasta","email":"schalasta@labor-enders.de","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Martin","surname":"Enders","email":"menders@labor-enders.de","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Meteorological

remains unknown.\n\n We aimed to estimate the global incidence of and mortality from episodes of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) due to RSV in children younger than 5 years in 2005.\nMethods\nWe estimated the incidence of RSV-associated ALRI in children younger than 5 years, stratified by age, using data from a systematic review of studies published between January, 1995, and June, 2009, and ten unpublished population-based studies.\n\n We estimated possible boundaries for RSV-associated ALRI mortality by combining case fatality ratios with incidence estimates from hospital-based reports from published and unpublished studies and identifying studies with population-based data for RSV seasonality and monthly ALRI mortality.\n\n\nFindings\nIn 2005, an estimated 33·8 (95% CI 19·3–46·2) million new episodes of RSV-associated ALRI occurred worldwide in children younger than 5 years (22% of ALRI episodes), with at least 3·4 (2·8–4·3) million episodes representing severe RSV-associated ALRI necessitating hospital admission.\n\n We estimated that 66?000–199?000 children younger than 5 years died from RSV-associated ALRI in 2005, with 99% of these deaths occurring in developing countries.\n\n Incidence and mortality can vary substantially from year to year in any one setting.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGlobally, RSV is the most common cause of childhood ALRI and a major cause of admission to hospital as a result of severe ALRI.\n\n Mortality data suggest that RSV is an important cause of death in childhood from ALRI, after pneumococcal pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae type b.\n\n The development of novel prevention and treatment strategies should be accelerated as a priority.\n\n\nFunding\nWHO; Bill &amp; Melinda Gates

globally prevalent cause of lower respiratory infection in neonates and infants.\n Despite its disease burden, a safe and effective RSV vaccine has remained elusive.\n In recent years, improved understanding of RSV biology and innovations in immunogen design has resulted in the advancement of multiple vaccine candidates into the clinical development pipeline.\n Given the growing number of vaccines in clinical trials, the rapid pace at which they are being tested, and the likelihood that an RSV vaccine will reach the commercial market in the next 5–10 years, consensus and guidance on clinical development pathways and licensure routes are needed now, before large-scale efficacy trials commence.\n In pursuit of this aim, the World Health Organization convened the first RSV vaccine consultation in 15 years on the 23rd and 24th of March, 2015 in Geneva, Switzerland.\n The meeting’s primary objective was to provide guidance on clinical endpoints and development pathways for vaccine trials with a focus on considerations of low- and middle-income countries.\n Meeting participants reached consensus on candidate case definitions for RSV disease, considerations for clinical efficacy endpoints, and the clinical development pathway for active and passive immunization trials in maternal and pediatric populations.\n The strategic focus of this meeting was on the development of high quality, safe and efficacious RSV preventive interventions for global use and included: (1) maternal/passive immunization to prevent RSV disease in infants less than 6 months; (2) pediatric immunization to prevent RSV disease in infants and young children once protection afforded by maternal immunization

respiratory infections (ALRI) in young children worldwide is unknown.\n\n We aimed to estimate the incidence of admissions and deaths for such infections in children younger than 5 years in

published between Jan 1, 1990, and March 31, 2012, and from 28 unpublished population-based studies.\n\n We applied these incidence estimates to population estimates for 2010, to calculate the global

ratios from hospital-based studies.\n\n\nFindings\nWe identified 89 eligible studies and estimated that in 2010, 11·9 million (95% CI 10·3–13·9 million) episodes of severe and 3·0 million (2·1–4·2 million) episodes of very severe ALRI resulted in hospital admissions in young children worldwide.\n\n Incidence was higher in boys than in girls, the sex disparity being greatest in South Asian studies.\n\n On the basis of data from 37 hospital studies reporting case fatality ratios for severe ALRI, we estimated that roughly 265?000 (95% CI 160?000–450?000) in-hospital deaths took place in

Bronchiolitis Hospitalization Rates in High-Risk Infants in a United States Nationally Representative Database, 1997–2012","abstract":"Background\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes significant pediatric morbidity and is the most common cause of bronchiolitis.\n\n Bronchiolitis hospitalizations declined among US infants from 2000?2009; however, rates in infants at high risk for RSV have not been described.\n\n This study examined RSV and unspecified bronchiolitis (UB) hospitalization rates from 1997?2012 among US high-risk infants.\n\n\nMethods\nThe Kids’ Inpatient Database (KID) infant annual RSV (ICD-9 079.6, 466.11, 480.1) and UB (ICD-9 466.19, 466.1) hospitalization rates were estimated using weighted counts.\n\n Denominators were based on birth hospitalizations with conditions associated with high-risk for RSV: chronic perinatal respiratory disease (chronic lung disease [CLD]); congenital airway anomalies (CAA); congenital heart disease (CHD); Down syndrome (DS); and other genetic, metabolic, musculoskeletal, and immunodeficiency conditions.\n\n Preterm infants could not be identified.\n\n Hospitalizations were characterized by mechanical ventilation, inpatient mortality, length of stay, and total cost (2015$).\n\n Poisson and linear regression were used to test statistical significance of trends.\n\n\nResults\nRSV and UB hospitalization rates were substantially elevated for infants with higher-risk CHD, CLD, CAA and DS without CHD compared with all infants.\n\n RSV rates declined by 47.0% in CLD and 49.7% in higher-risk CHD infants; no other declines in high-risk groups were observed.\n\n UB rates increased in all high-risk groups except for a 22.5% decrease among higher-risk CHD.\n\n Among high-risk infants, mechanical ventilation increased through 2012 to 20.4% and 13.5% of RSV and UB hospitalizations; geometric mean cost increased to $31,742 and $25,962, respectively, and RSV mortality declined to 0.9%.\n\n\nConclusions\nAmong high-risk infants between 1997 and 2012, RSV hospitalization rates declined among CLD and higher-risk CHD infants, coincident with widespread RSV immunoprophylaxis use in these populations.\n\n UB hospitalization rates increased in all high-risk groups except higher-risk CHD, suggesting improvement in the health status of higher-risk CHD infants, potentially due to enhanced surgical interventions.\n\n Mechanical ventilation use and RSV and UB hospitalization costs increased while RSV mortality declined.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4822775","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Abigail","surname":"Doucette","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaohui","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jon","surname":"Fryzek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jenna","surname":"Coalson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kimmie","surname":"McLaurin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christopher

Akershus, Norway, 1993–2000: a population-based retrospective study","abstract":"Background\nRSV is recognized as the most important cause of serious lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children worldwide leading to hospitalisation in a great number of cases, especially in certain high-risk groups.\n\n The aims of the present study were to identify risk groups, outcome and incidences of hospitalisation for RSV bronchiolitis in Norwegian children under two years of age and to compare the results with other studies.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a population-based retrospective survey for the period 1993–2000 in children under two years of age hospitalised for RSV bronchiolitis.\n\n\nResults\n822 admissions from 764 patients were identified, 93% had one hospitalisation, while 7% had two or more hospitalisations.\n\n Mean annual hospitalisation incidences were 21.7 per 1.000 children under one year of age, 6.8 per 1.000 children at 1–2 years of age and 14.1 per 1.000 children under two years of age.\n\n 77 children (85 admissions) belonged to one or more high-risk groups such as preterm birth, trisomy 21 and congenital heart disease.\n\n For preterm children under one year of age, at 1–2 years of age and under two years of age hospitalisation incidences per 1.000 children were 23.5, 8.7 and 16.2 respectively.\n\n The incidence for children under two years of age with trisomy 21 was 153.8 per 1.000 children.\n\n\nConclusion\nWhile the overall hospitalisation incidences and outcome of RSV bronchiolitis were in agreement with other studies, hospitalisation incidences for preterm children were lower than in many other studies.\n\n Age on admission for preterm children, when corrected for prematurity, was comparable to low-risk children.\n\n Length of hospitalisation and morbidity was high in both preterm children, children with a congenital heart disease and in children with trisomy 21, the last group being at particular high risk for severe disease.\n\n\n","id":"PMC544884","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hans-Olav","surname":"Fjaerli","email":"h.o.fjarli@medisin.uio.no","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Teresa","surname":"Farstad","email":"teresa.farstad@ahus.no","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dag","surname":"Bratlid","email":"dag.bratlid@medisin.ntnu.no","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1023/A:1022556215190","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiology
