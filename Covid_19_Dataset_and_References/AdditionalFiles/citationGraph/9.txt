coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle

COVID-19","abstract":"Seventeen years after the epidemic of SARS coronavirus, a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2-emerged resulting in an unprecedented pandemic.\n Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an essential receptor for cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the SARS coronavirus.\n Despite many similarities to SARS coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a higher affinity to ACE2 and shows higher infectivity and transmissibility, resulting in explosive increase of infected people and COVID-19 patients.\n Emergence of the variants harboring mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the Spike protein has drawn critical attention to the interaction between ACE2 and Spike and the efficacies of vaccines and neutralizing antibodies.\n ACE2 is a carboxypeptidase which degrades angiotensin II, B1-bradykinin, or apelin, and thereby is a critical regulator of cardiovascular physiology and pathology.\n In addition, the enzymatic activity of ACE2 is protective against acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by viral and non-viral pneumonias, aspiration, or sepsis.\n Upon infection, both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS coronaviruses downregulates ACE2 expression, likely associated with the pathogenesis of ARDS.\n Thus, ACE2 is not only the SARS-CoV-2 receptor but might also play an important role in multiple aspects of COVID-19 pathogenesis and possibly post-COVID-19 syndromes.\n Soluble forms of recombinant ACE2 are currently utilized as a pan-variant decoy to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and a supplementation of ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity.\n Here, we review the role of ACE2 in the pathology of ARDS in COVID-19 and the potential application of recombinant ACE2 protein for treating COVID-19.","id":"PMC8727358","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Keiji","surname":"Kuba","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tomokazu","surname":"Yamaguchi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Josef

cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in SARS-CoV-2-mediated cardiorenal damage.\n\n\nMethods and Results\nThe published RNA-sequencing datasets of cardiomyocytes infected with SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 patients were used.\n\n String, UMAP plots and single cell RNA sequencing data were analyzed to show the close relationship and distinct cardiorenal distribution patterns of ACE2, apelin and SGLT2. Intriguingly, there were decreases in ACE2 and apelin expression as well as marked increases in SGLT2 and endothelin-1 levels in SARS-CoV-2-infected cardiomyocytes, animal models with diabetes, acute kidney injury, heart failure and COVID-19 patients.\n\n These changes were linked with downregulated levels of interleukin (IL)-10, superoxide dismutase 2 and catalase as well as upregulated expression of profibrotic genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines.\n\n Genetic ACE2 deletion resulted in upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines containing IL-1?, IL-6, IL-17 and tumor necrosis factor ?.\n\n More importantly, dapagliflozin strikingly alleviated cardiorenal fibrosis in diabetic db/db mice by suppressing SGLT2 levels and potentiating the apelin-ACE2

that the apelin-ACE2 signaling and SGLT2 inhibitors are potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19

of the renin-angiotensin system, facilitator of amino acid transport, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 receptor.\n ACE2 is widely expressed, including, in the lungs, cardiovascular system, gut, kidneys, central nervous system, and adipose tissue.\n ACE2 has recently been identified as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the infective agent responsible for coronavirus disease 2019, providing a critical link between immunity, inflammation, ACE2, and cardiovascular disease.\n Although sharing a close evolutionary relationship with SARS-CoV, the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 differs in several key amino acid residues, allowing for stronger binding affinity with the human ACE2 receptor, which may account for the greater pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The loss of ACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing.\n The ACE2 system is a critical protective pathway against heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction including, myocardial infarction and hypertension, and against lung disease and diabetes mellitus.\n The control of gut dysbiosis and vascular permeability by ACE2 has emerged as an essential mechanism of pulmonary hypertension and diabetic cardiovascular complications.\n Recombinant ACE2, gene-delivery of Ace2, Ang 1–7 analogs, and Mas receptor agonists enhance ACE2 action and serve as potential therapies for disease conditions associated with an activated renin-angiotensin system.\n rhACE2 (recombinant human ACE2) has completed clinical trials and efficiently lowered or increased plasma angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 levels, respectively.\n Our review summarizes the progress over the past 20 years, highlighting the critical role of ACE2 as the novel SARS-CoV-2 receptor and as the negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, together with implications for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and associated cardiovascular diseases.\n","id":"PMC7188049","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mahmoud","surname":"Gheblawi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kaiming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anissa","surname":"Viveiros","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Quynh","surname":"Nguyen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiu-Chang","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anthony J.","surname":"Turner","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mohan K.","surname":"Raizada","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maria B.","surname":"Grant","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gavin Y.","surname":"Oudit","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1855","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Association of use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers with testing positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1089/ham.2017.0017","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Systemic hypoxia increases circulating concentration of apelin in humans","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.dsx.2017.07.016","date":"1970-01-01","title":"An overview on biological functions and emerging therapeutic roles of apelin in diabetes mellitus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3390/cells10040933","date":"2021-04-14","title":"Obesity as a Risk Factor for Severe COVID-19 and Complications: A Review","abstract":"Emerging data suggest that obesity is a major risk factor for the progression of major complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cytokine storm and coagulopathy in COVID-19. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the link between obesity and disease severity as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for the development of new therapeutic interventions and preventive measures in this high-risk group.\n We propose that multiple features of obesity contribute to the prevalence of severe COVID-19 and complications.\n First, viral entry can be facilitated by the upregulation of viral entry receptors, like angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), among others.\n Second, obesity-induced chronic inflammation and disruptions of insulin and leptin signaling can result in impaired viral clearance and a disproportionate or hyper-inflammatory response, which together with elevated ferritin levels can be a direct cause for ARDS and cytokine storm.\n Third, the negative consequences of obesity on blood coagulation can contribute to the progression of thrombus formation and hemorrhage.\n In this review we first summarize clinical findings on the relationship

Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304–130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020.

contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres,

implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of Sciences,

characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) strains.\n The molecular mechanisms regulating emerging coronavirus pathogenesis are complex and include virus–host interactions associated with entry, replication, egress and innate immune control.\n Epigenetics research investigates the genetic and non-genetic factors that regulate phenotypic variation, usually caused by external and environmental factors that alter host expression patterns and performance without any change in the underlying genotype.\n Epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications, DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs, function as important regulators that remodel host chromatin, altering host expression patterns and networks in a highly flexible manner.\n For most of the past two and a half decades, research has focused on the molecular mechanisms by which RNA viruses antagonize the signaling and sensing components that regulate induction of the host innate immune and antiviral defense programs upon infection.\n More recently, a growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that viruses, even lytic RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, have developed intricate, highly evolved, and well-coordinated processes that are designed to regulate the host epigenome, and control host innate immune antiviral defense processes, thereby promoting robust virus replication and pathogenesis.\n In this article, we discuss the strategies that are used to evaluate the mechanisms by which viruses regulate the host epigenome, especially focusing on highly pathogenic respiratory RNA virus infections as a model.\n By combining measures of epigenome reorganization with RNA and proteomic datasets, we articulate a spatial-temporal data integration approach to identify regulatory genomic clusters and regions that play a crucial role in the host’s innate immune response, thereby defining a new viral antagonism

coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically

new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in China","abstract":"id='Par1'>Emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Zika virus disease, present a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward

Disease Severity and Liver Injury in Coronavirus Disease-19","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic.\n\n Obesity has been associated with increased disease severity in COVID-19, and obesity is strongly associated with hepatic steatosis (HS).\n\n However, how HS alters the natural history of COVID-19 is not well characterized, especially in Western populations.\n\n\nAims\nTo characterize the impact of HS on disease severity and liver injury in COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe examined the association between HS and disease severity in a single-center cohort study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at Michigan Medicine.\n\n HS was defined by either hepatic steatosis index?&gt;?36 (for Asians) or?&gt;?39 (for non-Asians) or liver imaging demonstrating steatosis?&gt;?30 days before onset of COVID-19. The primary predictor was HS.\n\n The primary outcomes were severity of cardiopulmonary disease, transaminitis, jaundice, and portal hypertensive complications.\n\n\nResults\nIn a cohort of 342 patients, metabolic disease was highly prevalent including nearly 90% overweight.\n\n HS was associated with increased transaminitis and need for intubation, dialysis, and vasopressors.\n\n There was no association between HS and jaundice or portal hypertensive complications.\n\n In a sensitivity analysis including only patients with liver imaging?&gt;?30 days before onset of COVID-19, imaging evidence of hepatic steatosis remained associated with disease severity and risk of transaminitis.\n\n\nConclusions\nHS was associated with increased disease severity and transaminitis in COVID-19. HS may be relevant in predicting risk of complications related to COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7520076","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_Springer_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Vincent L.","surname":"Chen","email":"vichen@med.umich.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fadi","surname":"Hawa","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Fadi","surname":"Hawa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jeffrey A.","surname":"Berinstein","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chanakyaram A.","surname":"Reddy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ihab","surname":"Kassab","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kevin D.","surname":"Platt","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chia-Yang","surname":"Hsu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Calen A.","surname":"Steiner","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jeremy","surname":"Louissaint","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Naresh T.","surname":"Gunaratnam","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                              Pratima","surname":"Sharma","email":"pratimas@med.umich.edu","contributions":"1"}],"References":[{"doi":"10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30120-1","date":"1970-01-01","title":"An interactive web-based dashboard to track COVID-19 in real time","abstract":"","id":"PMC7159018","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ensheng","surname":"Dong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hongru","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lauren","surname":"Gardner","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"WHO statement regarding cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation reports","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Tracking the epidemic","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"10.14309/ajg.0000000000000620","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 Patients With Digestive Symptoms in Hubei, China: A Descriptive, Cross-Sectional, Multicenter Study","abstract":"OBJECTIVE:\nSince the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019, various digestive symptoms have been frequently reported in patients infected with the virus.\n\n In this study, we aimed to further investigate the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms.\n\n\nMETHODS:\nIn this descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study, we enrolled confirmed patients with COVID-19 who presented to 3 hospitals from January 18, 2020, to February 28, 2020. All patients were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and were analyzed for clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and treatment.\n\n Data were followed up until March 18, 2020.\nRESULTS:\nIn the present study, 204 patients with COVID-19 and full laboratory, imaging, and historical data were analyzed.\n\n The average age was 52.9 years (SD ± 16), including 107 men and 97 women.\n\n Although most patients presented to the hospital with fever or respiratory symptoms, we found that 103 patients (50.5%) reported a digestive symptom, including lack of appetite (81 [78.6%] cases), diarrhea (35 [34%] cases), vomiting (4 [3.9%] cases), and abdominal pain (2 [1.9%] cases).\n\n If lack of appetite is excluded from the analysis (because it is less specific for the gastrointestinal tract), there were 38 total cases (18.6%) where patients presented with a gastrointestinal-specific symptom, including diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.\n\n Patients with digestive symptoms had a significantly longer time from onset to admission than patients without digestive symptoms (9.0 days vs 7.3 days).\n\n In 6 cases, there were digestive symptoms, but no respiratory symptoms.\n\n As the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more pronounced.\n\n Patients with digestive symptoms had higher mean liver enzyme levels, lower monocyte count, longer prothrombin time, and received more antimicrobial treatment than those without digestive symptoms.\n\n\nDISCUSSION:\nWe found that digestive symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, these patients have a longer time from onset to admission, evidence of longer coagulation, and higher liver enzyme levels.\n\n Clinicians should recognize that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, are commonly among the presenting features of COVID-19 and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms.\n\n However, further large sample studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7172492","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mi","surname":"Mu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pengcheng","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Runsheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Junhong","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pibao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Baoguang","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xun","surname":"Niu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rongyu","surname":"Ping","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yingzhen","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tianzhi","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guogang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qinyong","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The

Anthropometric, clinical, and laboratory data were examined during regular health check-ups and fatty liver diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound.\n\n Logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine predictors of prevalent NAFLD and to derive risk scores/models.\n\n We validated our models and compared them with other existing methods using an external cohort (N?=?66868).\n\n\nResults\nThe simple self-assessment score consists of age, sex, waist circumference, body mass index, history of diabetes and dyslipidemia, alcohol intake, physical activity and menopause status, which are independently associated with NAFLD, and has a value of 0–15. A cut-off point of ?8 defined 58% of males and 36% of females as being at high-risk of NAFLD, and yielded a sensitivity of 80% in men (77% in women), a specificity of 67% (81%), a positive predictive value of 72% (63%), a negative predictive value of 76% (89%) and an AUC of 0.82 (0.88).\n\n Comparable results were obtained using the validation dataset.\n\n The comprehensive NAFLD score, which includes additional laboratory parameters, has enhanced discrimination ability, with an AUC of 0.86 for males and 0.91 for females.\n\n Both simple and comprehensive NAFLD scores were significantly increased in subjects with higher fatty liver grades or severity of liver conditions (e.\n\ng.\n\n, simple steatosis, steatohepatitis).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe new non–laboratory-based self-assessment

novel coronavirus disease (COVID?19).\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 174 consecutive patients confirmed with COVID?19 were studied.\n\n Demographic data, medical history, symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography (CT) as well the treatment measures were collected and analysed.\n\n\nResults\nWe found that COVID?19 patients without other comorbidities but with diabetes (n = 24) were at higher risk of severe pneumonia, release of tissue injury?related enzymes, excessive uncontrolled inflammation responses and hypercoagulable state associated with dysregulation of glucose metabolism.\n\n Furthermore, serum levels of inflammation?related biomarkers such as IL?6, C?reactive protein, serum ferritin and coagulation index, D?dimer, were significantly higher (P &lt;?.\n\n01) in diabetic patients compared with those without, suggesting that patients with diabetes are more susceptible to an inflammatory storm eventually leading to rapid deterioration of COVID?19.\nConclusions\nOur data support the notion that diabetes should be considered as a risk factor for a rapid progression and bad prognosis of COVID?19. More intensive attention should be paid to patients with diabetes, in case of rapid deterioration.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7228407","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Weina","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mingyue","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yalan","surname":"Dong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Haifeng","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zili","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chunxia","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Renjie","surname":"Qin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Haijun","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yin","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Keye","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Heng","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shanshan","surname":"Luo","email":"shsh689@126.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Desheng","surname":"Hu","email":"desheng.hu@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"1"}],"References":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Obesity and COVID-19 severity in a designated hospital in Shenzhen, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases in patients with COVID-19: a retrospective study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References":[{"doi":"10.1111/liv.14435","date":"2020-03-10","title":"Liver injury during highly pathogenic human coronavirus infections","abstract":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS?Cov?2), the pathogen of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID?19), has posed a serious threat to global public health.\n The WHO has declared the outbreak of SARS?CoV?2 infection an international public health emergency.\n Lung lesions have been considered as the major damage caused by SARS?CoV?2 infection.\n However, liver injury has also been reported to occur during the course of the disease in severe cases.\n Similarly, previous studies have shown that liver damage was common in the patients infected by the other two highly pathogenic coronavirus – severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS?CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS?CoV), and associated with the severity of diseases.\n In this review, the characteristics and mechanism of liver injury caused by SARS?CoV, MERS?CoV as well as SARS?CoV?2 infection were summarized, which may provide help for further studies on the liver injury of COVID?19.","id":"PMC7228361","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ling","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jia","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mengji","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dongliang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xin","surname":"Zheng","email":"xin11@hotmail.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1585","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical findings in a group of patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) outside of Wuhan, China: retrospective case series","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Pheumonia Diagnosis and Treatment","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Low alanine aminotransferase cut-off for predicting liver outcomes;

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan city and spread rapidly throughout China and the world.\n\n In this study, we aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of older patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nThis is a retrospective investigation of hospitalized older patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1, 2020, to February 10, 2020.\nResults\nIn total, 203 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, with a median age of 54 years (interquartile range, 41-68; range, 20-91 years).\n\n Men accounted for 108 (53.2%) of the cases, and 55 patients (27.1%) were &gt;65 years of age.\n\n Among patients who were 65 years and older, the mortality rate was 34.5% (19/55), which was significantly higher than that of younger patients at 4.7% (7/148).\n\n Common symptoms of older patients with COVID-19 included fever (94.5%; n=52), dry cough (69.1%; n=38), and chest distress (63.6%; n=35).\n\n Compared with young patients, older patients had more laboratory abnormalities and comorbidities.\n\n Through a multivariate analysis of the causes of death in older patients, we found that males, comorbidities, time from disease onset to hospitalization, abnormal kidney function, and elevated procalcitonin levels were all significantly associated with death.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn the recent outbreak of COVID-19, our local hospital in Wuhan found that patients aged 65 and older had greater initial comorbidities, more severe symptoms, and were more likely to experience multi-organ involvement and death, as compared with younger patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184388","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"TieLong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhe","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pingzheng","surname":"Mo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xinyu","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiyong","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shihui","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoping","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mingqi","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ke","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shicheng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongxi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Liping","surname":"Deng","email":"dengdeng78@126.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical

and 17 patients died (mortality, 16.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.4%-23.9%).\n\n Among patients who survived, they were younger, more likely were health care workers and less likely suffered from comorbidities.\n\n They were also less likely suffered from complications.\n\n There was no difference in drug treatment rates between the survival and non-survival groups.\n\n Patients who survived less likely required admission to the intensive care unit (14.1% vs.\n\n 35.3%).\n\n Chest imaging examination showed that death patients more likely had ground-glass opacity (41.2% vs.\n\n 12.9%).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe mortality rate was high among the COVID-19 patients described in our cohort who met our criteria for inclusion in this analysis.\n\n Patient characteristics seen more frequently in those who died were development of systemic complications following onset of the illness and the severity of disease requiring admission to the ICU.\n\n Our data support those described by others that COVID-19 infection results from human-to-human transmission, including familial clustering of cases, and nosocomial transmission.\n\n There were no differences in mortality among those who did or did not receive antimicrobial or glucocorticoid drug treatment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184479","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jianlei","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-Jun","surname":"Tu","email":"tuwenjun@irm-cams.ac.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenlin","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ya-Kun","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyong","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qiang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.chest.2020.04.010","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Risk

global health emergency.\n\n The cumulative number of new confirmed cases and deaths are still increasing out of China.\n\n Independent predicted factors associated with fatal outcomes remain uncertain.\n\n\nResearch Question\nThe goal of the current study was to investigate the potential risk factors associated with fatal outcomes from COVID-19 through a multivariate Cox regression analysis and a nomogram model.\n\n\nStudy Design and Methods\nA retrospective cohort of 1,590 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 throughout China was established.\n\n The prognostic effects of variables, including clinical features and laboratory findings, were analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier methods and a Cox proportional hazards model.\n\n A prognostic nomogram was formulated to predict the survival of patients with COVID-19.\nResults\nIn this nationwide cohort, nonsurvivors included a higher incidence of elderly people and subjects with coexisting chronic illness, dyspnea, and laboratory abnormalities on admission compared with survivors.\n\n Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age ? 75 years (hazard ratio [HR], 7.86; 95% CI, 2.44-25.35), age between 65 and 74 years (HR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.24-9.5), coronary heart disease (HR, 4.28; 95% CI, 1.14-16.13), cerebrovascular disease (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.07-8.94), dyspnea (HR, 3.96; 95% CI, 1.42-11), procalcitonin

nomogram was established based on the results of multivariate analysis.\n\n The internal bootstrap resampling approach suggested the nomogram has sufficient discriminatory power with a C-index of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.85-0.97).\n\n The calibration plots also showed good consistency between the prediction and the observation.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe proposed nomogram accurately predicted clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 based on individual characteristics.\n\n Earlier identification, more intensive surveillance, and appropriate therapy should be considered in patients at high

clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 are limited.\n\n\nObjective\nWe sought to evaluate the severity on admission, complications, treatment, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nPatients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 26, 2020, to February 5, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled and followed-up until March 3, 2020. Potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 were analyzed by a multivariable binary logistic model.\n\n Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for survival analysis in severe patients.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 269 (49.1%) of 548 patients as severe cases on admission.\n\n Older age, underlying hypertension, high cytokine levels (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-?), and high lactate dehydrogenase level were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on admission.\n\n The prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID-19 was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of Wuhan.\n\n The estimated mortality was 1.1% in nonsevere patients and 32.5% in severe cases during the average 32 days of follow-up period.\n\n Survival analysis revealed that male sex, older age, leukocytosis, high lactate dehydrogenase level, cardiac injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use were associated with death in patients with severe COVID-19.\nConclusions\nPatients with older age, hypertension, and high lactate dehydrogenase level need careful observation and early intervention to prevent the potential development of severe COVID-19.

Clinical Status in Human Cirrhosis and Corrects Post Liver Transplantation","abstract":"Introduction: Recent animal studies have shown that the alternate renin-angiotensin system (RAS) consisting of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), angiotensin-(1–7) (Ang-(1–7)) and the Mas receptor is upregulated in cirrhosis and contributes to splanchnic vasodilatation and portal hypertension.\n To determine the potential relevance of these findings to human liver disease, we evaluated its expression and relationship to the patients’ clinical status in subjects with cirrhosis.\n Methods: Blood sampling from peripheral and central vascular beds was performed intra-operatively for cirrhotic patients at the time of liver transplantation (LT) or trans-jugular intra-hepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedures to measure angiotensin II (Ang II) and Ang-(1–7) peptide levels and ACE and ACE2 enzyme activity.\n Relevant clinical and hemodynamic data were recorded pre-operatively for all subjects and peripheral blood sampling was repeated 3 months or later post-operatively.\n Results: Ang-(1–-7) and ACE2 activity were up-regulated more than twofold in cirrhotic subjects both at the time of LT and TIPS and levels returned to comparable levels as control subjects post-transplantation.\n Ang-(1–7) levels correlated positively with the degree of liver disease severity, as measured by the model for an end-stage liver disease (MELD) and also with clinical parameters of pathological vasodilatation including cardiac output (CO).\n There were strong correlations found between the ACE2:ACE and the Ang-(1–7):Ang II ratio highlighting the inter-dependence of the alternate and classical arms of the RAS and thus their potential impact on vascular tone.\n Conclusions: In human cirrhosis, the alternate RAS is markedly upregulated and the activation of this system is associated strongly with features of the hyperdynamic circulation in advanced human cirrhosis.\n","id":"PMC6518205","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Stephen","surname":"Casey","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Schierwagen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kai

Liver impairment has been frequently reported as a common manifestation, although its clinical significance is still unclear, particularly in patients with underlying chronic liver disease (CLD).\n\n\nAims\nTo summarise the changes in liver function tests during SARS?CoV?2 infection and the impact of COVID?19 in patients with underlying CLD.\n\n\nMethods\nA literature review using online database PubMed was done using the search terms “SARS?CoV?2”, “COVID?19”, “liver”, “cirrhosis” and “liver transplantation”.\n\n\nResults\nCOVID?19 is frequently associated with different degrees of abnormal liver function tests, most notably transaminases, which are usually transitory and of mild degree.\n\n Available evidence suggests that liver injury may result from direct pathogenic effect by the virus, systemic inflammation or toxicity from commonly used drugs in this subset of patients.\n\n SARS?CoV?2 infection in children is associated with minimal or no increase in liver enzymes, thus the presence of abnormal liver function tests should trigger evaluation for underlying liver diseases.\n\n Although it seems that patients with CLD are not at greater risk for acquiring the infection, those with cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, non?alcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune liver diseases or liver transplant may have a greater risk for severe COVID?19.\nConclusions\nAbnormal liver function tests during the course of COVID?19 are common, though clinically significant liver injury is rare.\n\n Further research is needed focusing on the

2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

tissue hypoxia.\n\n Therefore, we pursued the hypothesis, that tissue hypoxia may influence innate immune responses by transcriptional modulation of Toll-like receptor (TLRs) expression and function.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nWe gained first insight from transcriptional profiling of murine dendritic cells exposed to hypoxia (2% oxygen for 24 h).\n\n While transcript levels of other TLRs remained unchanged, we found a robust induction of TLR2 (2.36±0.7-fold; P&lt;0.05) and TLR6 (3.46±1.56-fold; P&lt;0.05).\n\n Additional studies in different cells types and cell-lines including human dendritic cells, monocytic cells (MM6), endothelia (HMEC-1) or intestinal epithelia (Caco-2) confirmed TLR2 and TLR6 induction of transcript, protein and function during hypoxia.\n\n Furthermore, analysis of the putative TLR2 and TLR6 promoters revealed previously unrecognized binding sites for HIF-1, which were shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation to bind the pivotal hypoxia-regulating transcription factor HIF-1alpha.\n\n Studies using loss and gain of function of HIF-1 confirmed a critical role of HIF-1alpha in coordinating TLR2 and TLR6 induction.\n\n Moreover, studies of murine hypoxia (8% oxygen over 6 h) showed TLR2 and TLR 6 induction in mucosal organs in vivo.\n\n In contrast, hypoxia induction of TLR2 and TLR6 was abolished in conditional HIF-1? mutant mice.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nTaking together, these studies reveal coordinated induction of TLR2 and TLR6 during hypoxia and suggest tissue hypoxia in transcriptional adaptation of innate immune responses during acute infection or

applied in studies.\n\n We evaluated the impact of short-term IH on vascular and metabolic function in a diet-induced model of metabolic syndrome (MS).\n\n\nMethods\nMice were fed either a standard diet or a high fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks.\n\n During the final 14 days of each diet, animals were exposed to either IH (1 min cycle, FiO2 5% for 30s, FiO2 21% for 30s; 8 h/day) or intermittent air (FiO2 21%).\n\n Ex-vivo vascular reactivity in response to acetylcholine was assessed in aorta rings by myography.\n\n Glucose, insulin and leptin levels were assessed, as well as serum lipid profile, hepatic mitochondrial activity and tissue nitric oxide (NO) release.\n\n\nResults\nMice fed with HFD developed moderate markers of dysmetabolism mimicking MS, including increased epididymal fat, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis and endothelial dysfunction.\n\n HFD decreased mitochondrial complex I, II and IV activities and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in liver.\n\n IH applied to HFD mice induced a major increase in insulin and leptin levels and prevented endothelial dysfunction by restoring NO production.\n\n IH also restored mitochondrial complex I and IV activities, moderated the increase in LDH activity and liver triglyceride accumulation in HFD mice.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn a mouse model of MS, short-term IH increases insulin and leptin levels, restores endothelial

(NASH).\n\n Another member of the toll-like receptor family, TLR-2, has been shown to play a role in lipid trafficking via uptake of diacylated lipoproteins.\n\n However, a role for TLR-2 in NASH has not been elucidated.\n\n The objectives of the current study were to examine the influence of dietary fat quality and TLR-2 on NASH pathogenesis.\n\n\nMethods\nSteatohepatitis was induced in male Db, C57BL/6 and TLR-2-/- mice by feeding an L-amino acid-defined diet that was deficient in methionine and choline (MCDD).\n\n Mice fed the base diet supplemented with methionine and choline (control diet; CD) were used as controls.\n\n To determine the role of fat quality, MCDD was enriched with polyunsaturated corn oil (PUFA) or coconut oil that is comprised mostly of saturated fat (SAFA); the total amount of each fat was 112.9 g/kg of diet.\n\n After 8 weeks of feeding CD or MCDD, hepatic steatosis, inflammation and necrosis were evaluated in histological sections.\n\n Total RNA was extracted from frozen liver samples and mRNA expression of TNF?, collagen ?1, IL-10, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-? (PPAR-?), TLR-4, and CD14, was analyzed via real-time PCR.\n\n Protein levels of TLR-2 were analyzed by western blot.\n\n\nResults\nPanlobular macrovessicular steatosis and diffuse leukocyte infiltration were noted in PUFA-fed Db mice.\n\n Histological scores demonstrated significantly less steatosis, inflammation and necrosis in SAFA-fed mice of all mouse strains.\n\n However, compared to wild type mice, hepatocellular damage was notably more severe in TLR-2-/- mice.\n\n Consistent with histological findings, mRNA expression of TNF? was elevated by approximately 3-fold in TLR-2-/- mice; PPAR-? expression was blunted in this strain compared to wild type.\n\n Expression of the matrix protein collagen ?I was also significantly higher in TLR-2-/- mice, indicating a pro-fibrogenic state.\n\n Sensitivity to steatohepatitis due to dietary fat or TLR-2 deficiency correlated significantly with alterations in the expression of TLR-4 as well as the co-receptor CD-14.\nConclusions\nOur findings suggest that dietary saturated fat plays a protective role against MCDD-induced steatohepatitis, whereas TLR-2 deficiency exacerbated NASH.\n\n The mechanism underlying the response to dietary fat and TLR-2 likely involves altered signalling via the TLR-4 pathway.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2891617","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chantal

attenuated hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and liver fibrosis via TGF-? and collagen in an experimental hepatic fibrosis model.\n The mechanism by which antibiotics attenuated LPS-TLR4 signaling and liver fibrosis was assessed.\n Notably, TLR4 mRNA level in the liver was elevated in the CDAA group and the CDAA-induced increase was significantly reduced by antibiotics.\n However, no significant differences were observed in the intestine among all groups.\n Elevated mRNA levels of LPS binding protein, which was correlated with serum endotoxin levels, were recognized in the CDAA

The tight junction protein (TJP) in the intestine, determined by immunohistochemical analysis was inversely associated with intestinal permeability.\n Antibiotics improved the intestinal permeability and enhanced TJP expression.\n Inhibition of LPS-TLR4 signaling with antibiotics attenuated liver fibrosis development associated with NASH via the inhibition of HSC activation.\n These results

assessed the effects of bacterial cell wall components on adiponectin, leptin and resistin secretion from rat visceral adipocytes in vitro.\n We also measured the relative population of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in fecal microbiota and the amount of fecal mucin as an intestinal barrier function, when mice were fed a high-fat diet.\n In the present study, we demonstrated that bacterial cell wall components affect the secretion of adipokines, depending on the presence of antigens from gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria.\n Lipopolysaccharide markedly inhibited adiponectin, leptin, and resistin secretion, whereas peptidoglycan increased adiponectin secretion and decreased resistin secretion in vitro.\n In vivo experiments showed that the high-fat diet increased the population of Firmicutes and decreased that of Bacteroidetes.\n In contrast, the high-fat diet downregulated the stool output and fecal mucin content.\n These results demonstrate that bacterial cell wall components affect the onset of metabolic syndromes by mediating the secretion of adipokines from visceral adipose tissue.\n Furthermore, we believe that metabolic endotoxemia is not due to the increasing dominance of gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroidetes, but due to the depression of intestinal barrier function.\n","id":"PMC4345181","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Risa","surname":"Taira","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sayori","surname":"Yamaguchi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kyoko","surname":"Shimizu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kiminori","surname":"Nakamura","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tokiyoshi","surname":"Ayabe","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Toshio","surname":"Taira","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.cgh.2013.02.015","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Fecal

not been studied in Asian Indians.\n\n In this case-control study, we aimed to analyse association of NAFLD with the sub-clinical inflammation and metabolic profile in Asian Indians in north India.\n\n\nMethods\nUltrasound diagnosed 120 cases of NAFLD were compared to 152 healthy controls without NAFLD.\n\n Anthropometric profile [body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC)], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), metabolic profile [fasting blood glucose (FBG), lipid profile] and hepatic function tests [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)] were recorded.\n\n\nResults\nMetabolic parameters [FBG, total cholesterol (TC), serum triglycerides (TG),low-density lipoprotein (LDL-c)], hs-CRP and prevalence of the metabolic syndrome were higher in cases as compared to controls (p-value&lt;0.05 for all).\n\n The median (range) of hs-CRP (mg/L) for cases [2.6(0.2–13.4)] were significantly higher than in controls [1.4(0.03–11.4), p?=?0.01].\n\n Similarly, higher values of hs-CRP were obtained when subgroups of cases with obesity, abdominal obesity and the metabolic syndrome were compared to controls

fatty liver disease (NAFLD) occur frequently in patients with obstructive lung disease (OLD).\n\n However, few studies have written about this relationship.\n\n This study aimed to investigate the relationship between OLD and NAFLD.\n\n\nSubjects and methods\nThe Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey is a national population-based, cross-sectional surveillance program that was initiated to assess the health and nutritional status of the Korean population.\n\n From 2007 to 2010, 11,738 subjects were enrolled.\n\n The subjects were defined as having NAFLD when they had scores higher than ?0.640 in a NAFLD liver fat score prediction model, which was a previously validated prediction score.\n\n Individuals with forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity &lt;0.7 were considered to have OLD.\n\n The subjects were divided into non-OLD and OLD groups and non-NAFLD and NAFLD groups.\n\n All analyses were performed using sample weighting using the complex samples plan.\n\n\nResults\nThe prevalences of NAFLD and OLD were 30.2% and 8.9%, respectively.\n\n Although not statistically significant, subjects in the NAFLD group involved a higher tendency of having OLD than did those in the non-NAFLD group (8.5% vs 10.0%, respectively, P=0.060).\n\n Subjects with OLD showed a higher tendency to have NAFLD than non-OLD subjects (30.0% vs 33.7%, respectively, P=0.060).\n\n NAFLD subjects were at higher odds of OLD (odds ratio=1.334; 95% confidence interval=1.108–1.607, P=0.002) than non-NAFLD subjects, after adjusting for age, sex, and smoking history.\n\n OLD subjects were at higher odds of NAFLD (odds ratio=1.556; 95% confidence interval=1.288–1.879, P&lt;0.001) than non-OLD subjects, after adjusting for age, sex, and smoking history.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis study showed that NAFLD is related to OLD.\n\n Clinicians should be aware of possible liver comorbidities in OLD patients and that extrahepatic disease in NAFLD patients may vary more than previously thought.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6118278","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sung

has been described, but the exact nature of this link remains unclear.\n\n Current epidemiological data refer exclusively to the MetS prevalence among patients with COPD and data about the prevalence of COPD in MetS patients are still unavailable.\n\n\nAim of the study\nTo analyse and compare risk factors, clinical and metabolic characteristics, as well as the main respiratory function parameters, among patients affected by MetS, COPD or both diseases.\n\n\nPatients\nWe recruited 59 outpatients with MetS and 76 outpatients with COPD.\n\n After medical history collection, physical examination, blood sampling for routine analysis, spirometric evaluation, they were subdivided into MetS (n = 46), MetS+COPD (n = 60), COPD (n = 29).\n\n\nResults\nA MetS diagnosis was assigned to 62% of COPD patients recruited in the COPD Outpatients Clinic of the Pneumology Department, while the COPD prevalence in MetS patients enrolled in the Internal Medicine Metabolic Disorders Outpatients Clinic was 22%.\n\n More than 60% of subjects enrolled in each Department were unaware that they suffered from an additional disease.\n\n MetS+COPD patients exhibited significantly higher C-peptide levels.\n\n We also found a positive relation between C-peptide and pack-years in all subjects and a negative correlation between C-peptide and vitamin D only in current smokers.\n\n Finally, a negative association emerged between smoking and vitamin D.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe have estimated, for the first time, the COPD prevalence in MetS and suggest a potential role of smoking in inducing insulin resistance.\n\n Moreover, a direct effect of smoking on vitamin D levels is proposed as a novel mechanism, which may account for both insulin resistance and COPD development.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5655494","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Giuseppina","surname":"Piazzolla","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anna","surname":"Castrovilli","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Anna","surname":"Castrovilli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vito","surname":"Liotino","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maria

insulin resistance indices calculated from 75-g oral glucose tolerance test data in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nLiver biopsy specimens were obtained from 72 patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and were scored for steatosis, grade and stage.\n\n Hepatic and skeletal muscle insulin resistance indices (hepatic insulin resistance index and Matsuda index, respectively) were calculated from 75-g oral glucose tolerance test data, and metabolic clearance rate was measured using the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp method.\n\n\nResults\nThe degree of hepatic steatosis, and grade and stage of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis were significantly correlated with Matsuda index (steatosis r = ?0.45, P &lt; 0.001; grade r = ?0.54, P &lt; 0.001; stage r = ?0.37, P &lt; 0.01), but not with hepatic insulin resistance index.\n\n Multiple regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, body mass index and each histological score showed that the degree of hepatic steatosis (coefficient = ?0.22, P &lt; 0.05) and grade (coefficient = ?0.40, P &lt; 0.01) were associated with Matsuda index, whereas the association between

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and

novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Background\nIn December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in China","abstract":"id='Par1'>Emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Zika virus disease, present a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward

244 with CHB [184 with and 60 without AVT] and 61 with NAFLD) was 55.6 years.\n\n The AUROC values for detecting hepatic steatosis were similar between patients with CHB (0.727; p&lt;0.001) and those with NAFLD (0.739;

antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nWe carried out a prospective nested case control study in CHB patients receiving Entecavir for initial antiviral therapy, by recording demographic, anthropometric and clinical data at baseline, 24wk, 48wk and 96wk.\n\n Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were applied to find out independent factors of hepatic steatosis and Entecavir treatment failure.\n\n The rates of HBV-DNA clearance, HBeAg seroconversion and ALT normalization were compared between CHB patients with and without steatosis by post hoc analysis.\n\n A total of 267 Chinese patients with CHB entered final analysis, with overall percentages of hepatic steatosis and HBeAg positive as 30.5% and 62.4%.\n\n Multivariate analysis showed waist circumference, serum TG and uric acid levels were independent factors of hepatic steatosis.\n\n The response rates to Entecavir were 54.9%, 63.8%, 74.2% at 24wk,

full spectrum of the disease ranges from simple steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC).\n\n The infiltration of inflammatory cells characterizes NASH.\n\n This characteristic contributes to the progression of hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC.\n\n Therefore, distinguishing NASH from NAFLD is crucial.\n\n\nObjective and Methods\nNinety-five patients with NAFLD, 44 with NASH, and 51 with non-NASH were included in the study to develop a new scoring system for differentiating NASH from NAFLD.\n\n Data on clinical and biological characteristics, as well as blood information, were obtained.\n\n Cytokeratin-18 (CK-18) fragments levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay.\n\n\nResults\nSeveral indexes show significant differences between the two groups, which include body mass index (BMI), waist-on-hip ratio (WHR), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), ?-glutamyl transpeptidase (?-GT), platelets, uric acid (UA), hs-C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), triglycerides (TG), albumin (ALB), and CK-18 fragments (all P &lt; 0.05).\n\n The CK-18 fragment levels showed a significant positive correlation with steatosis severity, ballooning, lobular inflammation, and fibrosis stage (all P &lt; 0.05).\n\n Therefore, a new model that combines ALT, platelets, CK-18 fragments, and TG was established by logistic regression among NAFLD patients.\n\n The AUROC curve in predicting NASH was 0.920 (95% CI: 0.866 - 0.974, cutoff value = 0.361, sensitivity = 89%, specificity = 86%, positive predictive value = 89%, negative predictive value = 89%).\n\n \nConclusion\nThe novel scoring system may be considered as a useful model in predicting

to noncontrast US surveillance in the early detection of HCC.\n\n The trial will also determine whether there are fewer false referrals with noncontrast MRI than with noncontrast US and, eventually, whether there is improvement in the overall survival of HCC patients.\n\n\nTrial registration\nid='Par4'>The date of trial registration (ClincalTrials.\n\ngov: NCT02514434) for this study is July 23, 2015. Enrollment of participants was finished in November 2017.

population","abstract":"Background/Aims\nHepatitis B virus (HBV) is the major cause of chronic liver disease in Korea, but viral prevalence has decreased because of hepatitis B vaccination programs.\n\n In this study, we investigated longitudinal changes in HBV in fection in the general Korean population.\n\n\nMethods\nHBV surface antigen (hepatitis B surface antigen, HBsAg) seropositivity was assessed from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (I to V).\n\n In total, 50,140 subjects were tested for serum HBsAg positivity over a period of 12 years (1998 to 2010).\n\n\nResults\nThe prevalence of HBsAg seropositivity decreased over the study period.\n\n The rates of HBsAg carriers were 4.61% in 1998, 4.60% in 2001, 3.69% in 2005, 3.01% in 2008, and 2.98% in 2010 (p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n The reduction in HBV infection rates was more prominent in younger age groups.\n\n Among teenagers (10 to 19 years), the percentage of HBsAg carriers decreased from 2.2% in 1998 to 0.12% in 2010 (p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n Among those aged 10 to 39 years, the percentage of HBV infection decreased from 4.72% in 1998 to 2.29% in 2010 (p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n However, no decreasing trend in HBsAg positivity was observed among those aged 50 or older (p &gt; 0.05).\n\n Neither gender nor socioeconomic status were associated with the decreased prevalence of HBsAg carriers.\n\n\nConclusions\nHBV infection has decreased in the Korean population since the advent of vaccination programs.\n\n However, the decrease is limited to the younger population, and viral persistence remains in the middle-aged and older population.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3712149","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hyuck","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"A

Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Meta-Analysis","abstract":"Background\nThe association between hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutations and hepatocarcinogenesis remains controversial because of conflicting data in the literature.\n\n We conducted a meta-analysis of case–control and cohort studies to examine HBV PreS, enhancer II (EnhII), basal core promoter (BCP), and precore mutations in relation to the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\n\n\nMethods\nWe searched databases for studies of these associations that were published in English or Chinese up to August 31, 2008. HBV mutation–specific odds ratios and relative risks were pooled by use of a random-effects model and stratified by potential confounders.\n\n All statistical tests were two-sided.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 43 studies included in this meta-analysis, 40 used a case–control design.\n\n The 43 studies evaluated a total of 11?582 HBV-infected participants, of whom 2801 had HCC.\n\n Statistically significant summary odds ratios of HCC were obtained for any PreS mutation (3.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.57 to 5.52), C1653T in EnhII (2.76, 95% CI = 2.09 to 3.64), T1753V (2.35, 95% CI = 1.63 to 3.40), and A1762T/G1764A in BCP (3.79, 95% CI = 2.71 to 5.29).\n\n PreS mutations were more strongly associated with an increased risk of HCC in subjects who were infected with HBV genotype C than in those who were infected with HBV genotype B, whereas the opposite was true for A1762T/G1764A.\n\n C1653T, T1753V, and A1762T/G1764A were more strongly associated with an increased risk of HCC in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)–positive subjects than in HBeAg-negative subjects.\n\n PreS mutations, C1653T, T1753V, and A1762T/G1764A accumulated during the progression of chronic HBV infection from the asymptomatic carrier state to HCC (Ptrend &lt; .\n\n001 for each mutation).\n\n PreS mutations, C1653T, C1653T + T1753V, and A1762T/G1764A-based combinations of mutations had specificities greater than 80% for the prediction of HCC.\n\n The precore mutations G1896A and C1858T were not associated with the risk of HCC, regardless of HBeAg status and HBV genotype.\n\n\nConclusions\nHBV PreS mutations, C1653T, T1753V, and A1762T/G1764A are associated with an increased risk of HCC.\n\n These mutations alone and in combination may be predictive for hepatocarcinogenesis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2720989","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Shijian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hongwei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chunying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jianhua","surname":"Yin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yongchao","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiaxin","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guangwen","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Should treatment of hepatitis B depend on hepatitis B virus genotypes?

(HCC).\n\n Modern antiviral therapies could stem the rising tide of hepatitis B-related HCC, provided that individuals and populations at risk can be reliably identified through hepatitis B screening and appropriately linked to care.\n\n Opportunistic disease screening cannot deliver population-level outcomes, given the large number of undiagnosed people, but they may be achievable through well-organized and targeted community-based screening interventions.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\n This review summarizes the experience with community-based CHB screening programs published in the English-language literature over the last 30 years.\n\n\nResults\n They include experiences from Taiwan, the USA, The Netherlands, New Zealand, and Australia.\n\n Despite great variability in program setting and design, successful programs shared common features, including effective community engagement incorporating the target population’s cultural values and the ability to provide low-cost or free access to care, including antiviral treatment.\n\n\nConclusion\n While many questions still remain about the best funding mechanisms to ensure program sustainability and what the most effective strategies are to ensure program reach, linkage to care, and access to treatment, the evidence suggests scope for cautious optimism.\n\n A number of successful, large-scale initiatives in the USA, Asia–Pacific, and Europe demonstrated the feasibility of community-based interventions in effectively screening large numbers of people with CHB.\n\n By providing an effective mechanism for community outreach, scaling up these interventions could deliver population-level outcomes in liver cancer prevention relevant for many countries with a large burden of

Screening and Vaccination Strategies for Newly Arrived Adult Canadian Immigrants and Refugees: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis ","abstract":"Background\nImmigrants have increased mortality from hepatocellular carcinoma as compared to the host populations, primarily due to undetected chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.\n\n Despite this, there are no systematic programs in most immigrant-receiving countries to screen for chronic HBV infection and immigrants are not routinely offered HBV vaccination outside of the universal childhood vaccination program.\n\n\nMethods and findings\nA cost-effective analysis was performed to compare four HBV screening and vaccination strategies with no intervention in a hypothetical cohort of newly-arriving adult Canadian immigrants.\n\n The strategies considered were a) universal vaccination, b) screening for prior immunity and vaccination, c) chronic HBV screening and treatment, and d) combined screening for chronic HBV and prior immunity, treatment and vaccination.\n\n The analysis was performed from a societal perspective, using a Markov model.\n\n Seroprevalence estimates, annual transition probabilities, health-care costs (in Canadian dollars), and utilities were obtained from the published literature.\n\n Acute HBV infection, mortality from chronic HBV, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs were modeled over the lifetime of the cohort of immigrants.\n\n Costs and QALYs were discounted at a rate of 3% per year.\n\n Screening for chronic HBV infection, and offering treatment if indicated, was found to be the most cost-effective intervention and was estimated to cost $40,880 per additional QALY gained, relative to no intervention.\n\n This strategy was most cost-effective for immigrants &lt; 55 years of age and would cost &lt; $50,000 per additional QALY gained for immigrants from areas where HBV seroprevalence is ? 3%.\n\n Strategies that included HBV vaccination were either prohibitively expensive or dominated by the chronic HBV screening strategy.\n\n\nConclusions\nScreening for chronic HBV infection from regions where most Canadian immigrants originate, except for Latin America and the Middle East, was found to be reasonably cost-effective and has the potential to reduce HBV-associated morbidity and mortality.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3799697","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Carmine","surname":"Rossi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kevin","surname":"Schwartzman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Olivia","surname":"Oxlade","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marina

meta-analyses for effectiveness in assessing liver fibrosis in European populations with chronic hepatitis C (CHC).\n\n However, these data cannot be extrapolated to populations in Asian countries, where chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is more prevalent.\n\n In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the overall performance of TE for assessing liver fibrosis in patients with CHB.\n\n\n\nMethods\nStudies from the literature and international conference abstracts which enrolled only patients with CHB or performed a subgroup analysis of such patients were enrolled.\n\n Combined effects were calculated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) and diagnostic accuracy values of each study.\n\n\nResult\nA total of 18 studies comprising 2,772

Hepatocellular Carcinoma","abstract":"Background\nThe risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) increases with increasing level of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in serum (viral load).\n\n However, it is unclear whether genetic characteristics of HBV, including HBV genotype and specific genetic mutations, contribute to the risk of HCC.\n\n We examined the HCC risk associated with HBV genotypes and common variants in the precore and basal core promoter (BCP) regions.\n\n\nMethods\nFrom January 5, 1991, to December 21, 1992, baseline blood samples were collected from 2762 Taiwanese men and women who were seropositive for HBV surface antigen but had not been diagnosed with HCC; the samples were tested for HBV viral load by real-time polymerase chain reaction and genotyped by melting curve analysis.\n\n Participants who had a baseline serum HBV DNA level greater than 104 copies/mL (n = 1526) were tested for the precore G1896A and BCP A1762T/G1764A mutants by direct sequencing.\n\n Incident cases of HCC were ascertained through follow-up examinations and computerized linkage to the National Cancer Registry and death certification profiles.\n\n A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the risk of HCC associated with HBV genotype and precore and BCP mutants after adjustment for other risk factors.\n\n All statistical tests were two-sided.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 153 HCC cases occurred during 33?847 person-years of follow-up.\n\n The HCC incidence rates per 100?000 person-years for participants infected with HBV genotype B or C were 305.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 236.9 to 388.1) and 785.8 (95% CI = 626.8 to 972.9), respectively.\n\n Among participants with a baseline HBV DNA level of at least 104 copies/mL, HCC incidence per 100?000 person-years was higher for those with the precore G1896 (wild-type) variant than for those with the G1896A variant (955.5 [95% CI = 749.0 to 1201.4] vs 269.4 [95% CI = 172.6 to 400.9]) and for those with the BCP A1762T/G1764A double mutant than for those with BCP A1762/G1764 (wild-type) variant (1149.2 [95% CI = 872.6 to 1485.6] vs 358.7 [95% CI = 255.1 to 490.4]).\n\n The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of developing HCC was 1.76 (95% CI = 1.19 to 2.61) for genotype C vs genotype B, 0.34 (95% CI = 0.21 to 0.57) for precore G1896A vs wild type, and 1.73 (95% CI = 1.13 to 2.67) for BCP A1762T/G1764A vs wild type.\n\n Risk was highest among participants infected with genotype C HBV and wild type for the precore 1896 variant and mutant for the BCP 1762/1764 variant (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.99, 95% CI = 1.57 to 5.70, P &lt; .\n\n001).\n\n\nConclusions\nHBV genotype C and specific alleles of BCP and precore were associated with risk of HCC.\n\n These associations were independent of serum HBV DNA level.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2518166","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hwai-I","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiou-Hwei","surname":"Yeh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pei-Jer","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Uchenna

Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis B: a cross-sectional survey with pair-matched healthy controls","abstract":"Objective\nFew studies have evaluated health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in mainland China.\n\n We aimed at characterizing the impact of CHB on HRQoL in mainland Chinese and finding out factors associated with HRQoL.\n\n\nMethods\n460 CHB patients (323 with CHB only, 54 with compensated cirrhosis and 83 with decompensated cirrhosis) and 460 pair-matched healthy controls were recruited in Xi’an city.\n\n They answered a structured questionnaire including the Short Form 36 version 2 (SF-36v2), the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ) (only for patients), and questions on socio-demographic and clinical characteristics.\n\n A blood sample was collected from each of patients for liver function tests.\n\n SF-36v2 scores were compared between patients and controls overall and by groups by paired-samples t-test, and CLDQ scores and paired differences of SF-36v2 scores were compared among three patient groups by one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test.\n\n Multi-variable linear regression analyses were performed to identify determinants of HRQoL in patients.\n\n\nResults\nPatients, overall and by groups had significantly lower SF-36v2 scores than controls on all summaries and domains, with differences higher than the suggested minimally important difference values.\n\n Both the SF-36v2 and the CLDQ showed that HRQoL of patients with cirrhosis further deteriorated, but compensated and decompensated cirrhosis patients had similar total HRQoL impairments.\n\n The gradually increasing impairment with disease progression was confirmed only on physical components.\n\n Impaired liver function and currently taken anti-viral treatment were associated with lower HRQoL.\n\n Education attainment and annual per capita household income had a positive effect on HRQoL.\n\n\nConclusions\nMainland Chinese CHB patients suffered significant HRQoL impairment on all health dimensions, and the impairment reached a high level on mental health at initial stage of illness and increased gradually on physical health with disease progression.\n\n Attention should be paid to the reduction of patients’ treatment cost burden and the provision of early health education accompanied with proper treatments.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4067057","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Guihua","surname":"Zhuang","email":"zhuanggh@mail.xjtu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Zhang","email":"mintuo858@163.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Liu","email":"liuy5599@mail.xjtu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaling","surname":"Guo","email":"guoyaling123@126.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qian","surname":"Wu","email":"wuqian@mail.xjtu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kaina","surname":"Zhou","email":"dfyq100@163.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhenhao","surname":"Ji","email":"xiaojianke1259@163.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaomei","surname":"Zhang","email":"nxyxyzxm@163.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1186/1472-6963-13-386","date":"2013-09-30","title":"Effects

HRQOL for patients with chronic hepatitis B.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients with chronic hepatitis B eligible for our study were randomly selected in three model regions of Jiangsu Province in June 2010. 272 patients were invited and 254 took part, with a refusal rate of 6.62%.\n\n Comprehensive intervention included government support, technical guidance from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, standardised medical care, and community involvement.\n\n HRQOL before and 1 year after intervention was measured with the Short Form 36 and HBV-specific health surveys.\n\n Chi-square

with chronic hepatitis B","abstract":"In the phase-III GLOBE/015 studies, telbivudine demonstrated superior efficacy vs lamivudine during 2-year treatment in HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB).\n After completion, 847 patients had an option to continue telbivudine treatment for further 2 years.\n A total of 596 (70%) of telbivudine-treated patients, who were serum HBV DNA positive or negative and without genotypic resistance to telbivudine at the end of the GLOBE/015 trials, were enrolled into a further 2-year extension study.\n A group of 502 patients completed 4 years of continuous telbivudine treatment and were included in the telbivudine per-protocol population.\n Amongst 293 HBeAg-positive patients, 76.2% had undetectable serum HBV DNA and 86.0% had normal serum ALT at the end of 4 years.\n Notably, the cumulative rate of HBeAg seroconversion was 53.2%.\n Amongst 209 HBeAg-negative patients, 86.4% had undetectable HBV DNA and 89.6% had normal serum ALT.\n In patients who had discontinued telbivudine treatment due to HBeAg seroconversion, the HBeAg response was durable in 82% of patients (median 111 weeks of off-treatment follow-up).\n The cumulative 4-year resistance rate was 10.6% for HBeAg-positive and 10.0% for HBeAg-negative patients.\n Most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and transient.\n Renal function measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) increased by 14.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 (16.6%) from baseline to 4 years (P &lt; 0.0001).\n In conclusion, in HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative CHB patients without resistance after 2 years, two additional years of telbivudine treatment continued to provide effective viral suppression with a favourable safety profile.\n Moreover, telbivudine achieved 53% of HBeAg seroconversion in HBeAg-positive patients.\n","id":"PMC3618368","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Y","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S","surname":"Thongsawat","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"E

who received 30 mg of CLV once daily for at least 12 months were investigated.\n\n\nResults\nThe cumulative rates at months 12, 24, and 36, respectively, were 65.8%, 74.7%, and 74.7% for undetectable

dipivoxil therapy versus entecavir monotherapy for the treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B: a meta-analysis","abstract":"Background\nCurrently, there is no consensus on the efficacy and resistance of de novo combination therapy versus monotherapy for treatment naive patients of chronic hepatitis B (CHB).\n\n\nObjectives\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and resistance of de novo combination of lamivudine (LAM) and adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) compared with entecavir (ETV) monotherapy for nucleos(t)ide–naive patients with CHB.\n\n\nStudy design\nPublications on the effectiveness and resistance of LAM plus ADV versus ETV monotherapy for nucleos(t)ide-naive patients with CHB were identified by a search of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of science, OVID, and CBM (Chinese Biological Medical Literature) until May 1, 2013. Biochemical response, hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion, and viroligic response were extracted and combined to obtain an integrated result.\n\n Viral resistance and safety were reviewed.\n\n\nResults\nFive eligible studies (328 patients in total) were included in the analysis.\n\n LAM plus ADV combination therapy produced more rapid HBV DNA reduction rate at 12 weeks than that of ETV monotherapy.\n\n At 48 weeks, the combination group had superior viroligic response rates compared with ETV group (90.0% vs.\n\n 78.9%, P=0.01).\n\n The difference in the ALT normalization and HBeAg seroconversion rates was not found.\n\n At week 96, LAM?+?ADV was more effective than ETV in ALT normalization [RR?=?1. 11, 95% CI (1.02, 1.21), P =0.01] and HBeAg seroconversion [RR?=?2.00, 95% CI (1.26, 3.18, P=0.003)], and no significant difference was found in the virologic response (P =0.23).\n\n No viral resistance occurred in combination therapy and six patients in ETV group were experienced with viral breakthrough.\n\n Both groups were well tolerated.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe de novo LAM plus ADV combination therapy for treatment-naïve patients with CHB was greater than ETV monotherapy in both biochemical response and HBeAg seroconversion rate up to 96 weeks.\n\n The rate of emergence of viral resistance in the combination group was less than that in the ETV monotherapy.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3986697","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fen","surname":"Liu","email":"liu2011fen@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiwei","surname":"Wang","email":"yidaxiwei@126.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fang","surname":"Wei","email":"wf1988@126.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Huaidong","surname":"Hu","email":"hhd0126@163.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dazhi","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangdazhi_1014@163.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Hu","email":"hp_cq@163.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Ren","email":"renhong0531@vip.sina.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1053/j.gastro.2012.05.037","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Efficacy

NUCs Therapy with Different Prolonged Consolidation Therapy in HBeAg Positive CHB Patients","abstract":"Background\nMany chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients recur after off-therapy and have to accept prolonged consolidation therapy with NUCs.\n\n We investigated the rate of HBV relapse after stopping NUCs therapy with different time period of prolonged consolidation therapy in HBeAg positive CHB patients, and analyzed the associated-factor of recurrence.\n\n\nMethods\nWe recruited 162 HBeAg-positive CHB patients who met the standard of stopping NUCs therapy recommended by the 2005 APASL.\n\n Patients in group A, without the prolonged consolidation therapy, were as controls.\n\n Patients in group B were divided into 3 subgroups (group B1, 7 (range 3–11) months of the prolonged consolidation therapy; group B2, 17 (range 13–20) months of the prolonged consolidation therapy; group B3, 28 (range 25–34) months of the prolonged consolidation therapy).\n\n Virologic relapse was defined as an increase in serum HBV DNA to &gt;103copies/ml after off-therapy.\n\n\nResults\nOne hundred and thirty-six patients (group A, 40 patients; group B1, 54 patients; group B2, 23 patients; group B3, 19 patients) were eligible for this study.\n\n The cumulative rates of relapse in group B at 6 months and 48 months were 29.2%, 41.7% after off-therapy, respectively.\n\n The cumulative rates of relapse in group B were statistically lower than that in group A at the same time periods.\n\n The cumulative rate of relapse in group B3 or group B2 was statistically lower than that in group B1, respectively.\n\n On multivariate analysis by Cox’s proportional hazard model, age at off-therapy, baseline ALT and the different time period of the prolonged consolidation therapy were associated with the relapse of HBV after off-therapy.\n\n\nConclusions\nConsolidation therapy with NUCs after HBeAg seroconversion should be further prolonged.\n\n Age at off-therapy, ALT at baseline and the time period of the prolonged consolidation therapy could provide information to direct anti-viral therapy.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3701059","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xingfei","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ka","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaoan","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiayi","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Haixia","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xuejun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qingqiang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Geng","surname":"An","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qihuan","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Matti","surname":"Sällberg","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Matti","surname":"Sällberg","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Long-term

address this issue, we did a review of the literatures and analyzed the data with emphasis on the survival and reduction in serum HBV DNA level.\n\n\nMethods\nWe searched 11 randomized controlled trials that included 654 patients with chronic hepatitis B-associated liver failure.\n\n 340 patients adopted nucleoside analogue, such as lamivudine (LAM), entecavir (ETV), telbivudine (LdT), or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and the remaining 314 patients adopted no nucleoside analogue or placebo.\n\n A meta-analysis was carried out to examine the survival, HBV e antigen serologic conversion, and reduction in serum HBV DNA level.\n\n The pooled odds ratio (OR) was used to reflect the treatment effects.\n\n\nResults\nThe overall analysis revealed nucleoside analogue significantly improved 1-month(OR?=?2.10; 95% CI, [1.29, 3.41]; p?=?0.003), 3-month (OR?=?2.15; 95% CI, [1.26, 3.65]; p?=?0.005), 12-month survival (OR?=?4.62; 95% CI, [1.96, 10.89]; p?=?0.0005).\n\n Comparison of 3-month HBV DNA showed significant reduction for adoptive nucleoside analogue patients (OR?=?54.47; 95% CI, [16.37, 201.74]; p&lt;0.00001).\n\n Comparison of 3-month HBV e antigen serologic conversion showed a highly significant improvement of HBV e antigen lost for patients received adoptive antiviral therapy (OR?=?6.57; 95% CI, [1.64, 26.31]; p?=?0.008).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe benefits of nucleoside analogue on patients with chronic hepatitis B-associated liver failure is significant for improving patient survival, HBV e antigen serologic conversion, and rapid reduction of HBV DNA

experiencing severe acute exacerbation: a prospective observational study","abstract":"Background\nSevere acute exacerbation in chronic hepatitis B could lead to mortality in some patients unless timely liver transplantation is performed.\n\n The baseline bilirubin level has been reported to be an important prognostic factor for mortality.\n\n Here we conducted a prospective observational study to examine the clinical performance of this predictor.\n\n\nMethod\nTwenty-one consecutive chronic hepatitis B patients experiencing severe acute exacerbation were treated with either telbivudine or entecavir.\n\n The clinical characteristics at baseline and week-2 were documented and correlated with mortality.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 21 patients included, 9 had baseline bilirubin &gt;10 mg/dL.\n\n Four of these 9 patients (44.4%) eventually died, whereas all other patients survived.\n\n During the initial 2-week period, the change of bilirubin was ?1.2 mg/dl in the survivors, but was +8.05 mg/dl in the mortalities (P = 0.009).\n\n When this on-treatment factor was combined, 5 of the 21 patients had baseline bilirubin &gt; 10 mg/dL plus an increase of bilirubin level at week-2. Of these 5 patients, 4 (80%) died.\n\n Thus, by combining the baseline and on-treatment bilirubin levels, a positive predictive value of 80% and a negative predictive value of 100% could be achieved.\n\n Other significant on-treatment mortality predictors (at week-2) included higher international normalized ratio of prothrombin time (2.75 vs.\n\n 1.3, P = 0.004), higher model for end-stage liver disease score (30 vs.\n\n 17, P = 0.006), lower alpha-fetoprotein level (36.3 vs.\n\n 459.6 ng/mL, P = 0.039), and more rapid deterioration of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (P = 0.008).\n\n Interestingly, during the course, deterioration of eGFR was statistically significant in entecavir-treated (P = 0.028), but not in telbivudine-treated patients.\n\n Additionally, the patients treated with telbivudine had significant increase in serum alpha-fetoprotein (27.9 to 191.9 ng/ml, P = 0.046) in the first 2 weeks, whereas the corresponding feature was not found in those treated with entecavir (P = 0.139).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this prospective observational study, we discovered that the baseline and on-treatment bilirubin levels should be combined to achieve a better predictive value.\n\n Telbivudine might have a renoprotective effect in addition to its efficacy in viral suppression in patients with severe acute exacerbation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3766709","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yi-Cheng","surname":"Chen","email":"yichengliver@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chao-Wei","surname":"Hsu","email":"hsu2406@adm.cgmh.org.tw","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ming-Yang","surname":"Chang","email":"mingyc@adm.cgmh.org.tw","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chau-Ting","surname":"Yeh","email":"chautingy@gmail.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/hep.24109","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Tenofovir improves the outcome in patients with spontaneous reactivation of hepatitis B presenting as acute-on-chronic liver failure","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Jindal A, Kumar M, Sarin SK.

P?=?0.758).\n On-treatment analysis indicated 0% of HBsAg+ infants in the treated group versus 2.84% in the NTx group (P?=?0.002).\n There were no differences for gestational age or infants' height, weight, Apgar scores, or birth defect rates between infants from the treated and untreated groups.\n Conclusions: LdT and LAM use in late pregnancy for highly viremic mothers was equally effective in reducing MTCT.\n The treatment was well tolerated with no safety concerns identified.\n","id":"PMC4282428","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Calvin Q","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qiumei","surname":"Pang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ruihua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Miaoe","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xin","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jcv.2014.06.005","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Comparison of telbivudine versus lamivudine in interrupting perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3748/wjg.v19.i48.9377","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Efficacy and safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in pregnancy for the prevention of vertical transmission of HBV infection","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1128/AAC.00514-10","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Concentrations of tenofovir and emtricitabine in breast milk of HIV-1-infected women in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, in the ANRS12109 TEmAA Study, step 2","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0029-7844(02)02000-8","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Risk of hepatitis B transmission in breast-fed infants of chronic hepatitis B carriers","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1111/apt.12726","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Anti-viral therapy for prevention of perinatal HBV transmission: extending therapy beyond birth does not protect against post-partum flare","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1111/apt.12538","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Nucleos(t)ide analogues in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection and chronic kidney disease","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(74)92012-1","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Glomerulonephritis associated with hepatitis-B surface antigen immune complexes in children","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Extrahepatic manifestations of chronic viral hepatitis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJM197904123001502","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Free, &quot;small&quot;

Humans","abstract":"Using patient data from a unique single source outbreak of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, we have characterized the kinetics of acute HBV infection by monitoring viral turnover in the serum during the late incubation and clinical phases of the disease in humans.\n HBV replicates rapidly with minimally estimated doubling times ranging between 2.2 and 5.8 d (mean 3.7 ± 1.5 d).\n After a peak viral load in serum of nearly 1010 HBV DNA copies/ml is attained, clearance of HBV DNA follows a two or three phase decay pattern with an initial rapid decline characterized by mean half-life (t\n1/2) of 3.7 ± 1.2 d, similar to the t\n1/2 observed in the noncytolytic clearance of covalently closed circular DNA for other hepadnaviruses.\n The final phase of virion clearance occurs at a variable rate (t\n1/2 of 4.8 to 284 d) and may relate to the rate of loss of infected hepatocytes.\n Free virus has a mean t\n1/2 of at most 1.2 ± 0.6 d.\n We estimate a peak HBV production rate of at least 1013 virions/day and a maximum production rate of an infected hepatocyte of 200–1,000 virions/day, on average.\n At this peak rate of virion production we estimate that every possible single and most double mutations would be created each day.\n","id":"PMC2193367","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Simon

biochemical breakthrough after 9 days, suggesting LMV resistance.\n Rescue therapy with ‘add-on’ tenofovir brought about a sustained improvement in biochemical, serological and virological markers until HBsAg was lost after 4 months.\n Thus, this is the second adult HBV mono-infected patient, who responded successfully to tenofovir in severe

viral proteins that result in disease and impact the immune system's ability to eliminate the virus.\n We previously described the use of polymer-based Dynamic PolyConjugate (DPC) for the targeted

with a liver-tropic cholesterol-conjugated siRNA (chol-siRNA) targeting coagulation factor VII (F7) results in efficient F7 knockdown in mice and nonhuman primates without changes in clinical chemistry or induction of cytokines.\n Using transient and transgenic mouse models of HBV infection, we show that a single coinjection of NAG-MLP with potent chol-siRNAs targeting conserved HBV sequences resulted in multilog repression of viral RNA, proteins, and viral DNA with long duration of effect.\n These results suggest that coinjection of NAG-MLP and chol-siHBVs holds great promise as

pathogens.\n To examine the immunological basis of this paradox we studied the ability of hepatocellularly expressed hepatitis B virus (HBV) to activate immunologically naïve HBV-specific CD8+ T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic T cells after adoptive transfer to HBV transgenic mice.\n Intrahepatic priming triggered vigorous in situ T cell proliferation but failed to induce interferon gamma production or cytolytic effector function.\n In contrast, the same T cells differentiated into cytolytic effector T cells in HBV transgenic mice if Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) expression was genetically ablated, suggesting that intrahepatic antigen presentation per se triggers negative regulatory signals that prevent the functional differentiation of naïve CD8+ T cells.\n Surprisingly, coadministration of an agonistic anti-CD40 antibody (?CD40) inhibited PD-1 induction and restored T cell effector function, thereby inhibiting viral gene expression and causing a necroinflammatory liver disease.\n Importantly, the depletion of myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) strongly diminished the ?CD40 mediated functional differentiation of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells, suggesting that activation of mDCs was responsible for the functional differentiation of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells in ?CD40 treated animals.\n These results demonstrate that antigen-specific, PD-1-mediated CD8+ T cell exhaustion can be rescued by CD40-mediated mDC-activation.\n","id":"PMC3708877","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Masanori","surname":"Isogawa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Josan","surname":"Chung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yasuhiro","surname":"Murata","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kazuhiro","surname":"Kakimi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Francis

Activation of Innate Immune Cells in Human Liver","abstract":"The ability of innate immune cells to sense and respond to impending danger varies by anatomical location.\n The liver is considered tolerogenic but is still capable of mounting a successful immune response to clear various infections.\n To understand whether hepatic immune cells tune their response to different infectious challenges, we probed mononuclear cells purified from human healthy and diseased livers with distinct pathogen-associated molecules.\n We discovered that only the TLR8 agonist ssRNA40 selectively activated liver-resident innate immune cells to produce substantial quantities of IFN-?.\n We identified CD161Bright mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) and CD56Bright NK cells as the responding liver-resident innate immune cells.\n Their activation was not directly induced by the TLR8 agonist but was dependent on IL-12 and IL-18 production by ssRNA40-activated intrahepatic monocytes.\n Importantly, the ssRNA40-induced cytokine-dependent activation of MAIT cells mirrored responses induced by bacteria, i.\ne.\n, generating a selective production of high levels of IFN-?, without the concomitant production of TNF-? or IL-17A.\n The intrahepatic IFN-? production could be detected not only in healthy livers, but also in HBV- or HCV-infected livers.\n In conclusion, the human liver harbors a network of immune cells able to modulate their immunological responses to different pathogen-associated molecules.\n Their ability to generate a strong production of IFN-? upon stimulation with TLR8 agonist opens new therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of diverse liver

with adverse outcomes in patients with CLD who acquire the novel coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19).\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a multi-center, observational cohort study across 21 institutions in the United States (US) of adult patients with CLD and laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and May 30, 2020. We performed survival analysis to identify independent predictors of all-cause mortality and COVID-19 related mortality, and multivariate logistic regression to determine the risk of severe COVID-19 in patients with CLD.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 978 patients in our cohort, 867 patients (mean age 56.9 ± 14.5 years, 55% male) met inclusion criteria.\n\n The overall all-cause mortality was 14.0% (n = 121), and 61.7% (n = 535) had severe COVID-19. Patients presenting with diarrhea or nausea/vomiting were more likely to have severe COVID-19. The liver-specific factors associated with independent risk of higher overall mortality were alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) (hazard ratio [HR] 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29–4.55), decompensated cirrhosis (HR 2.91 [1.70–5.00]) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (HR 3.31 [1.53–7.16]).\n\n Other factors were increasing age, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and current smoker.\n\n Hispanic ethnicity (odds ratio [OR] 2.33 [1.47–3.70]) and decompensated cirrhosis (OR 2.50 [1.20–5.21]) were independently associated with risk for severe COVID-19.\nConclusions\nThe risk factors which predict higher overall mortality among patients with CLD and COVID-19 are ALD, decompensated cirrhosis and HCC.\n\n Hispanic ethnicity and decompensated cirrhosis are associated with severe COVID-19.

Only one subgroup—Asians and Pacific Islanders—experienced an improvement in mortality from hepatocellular carcinoma: the death rate decreased by 2.7% (95% confidence interval 2.2% to 3.3%, P&lt;0.001) per year.\n\n Annual increases in cirrhosis related mortality were most pronounced for Native Americans (designated as “American Indians” in the census database) (4.0%, 2.2% to 5.7%, P=0.002).\n\n The age adjusted death rate due to hepatocellular carcinoma increased annually by 2.1% (1.9% to 2.3%, P&lt;0.001); deaths due to cirrhosis began increasing in 2009 through 2016 by 3.4% (3.1% to 3.8%, P&lt;0.001).\n\n During 2009-16 people aged 25-34 years experienced the highest average annual increase in cirrhosis related mortality (10.5%, 8.9% to 12.2%, P&lt;0.001), driven entirely by alcohol related liver disease.\n\n During this period, mortality due to peritonitis and sepsis in the setting of cirrhosis increased substantially, with respective annual increases of 6.1% (3.9% to 8.2%) and 7.1% (6.1% to 8.4%).\n\n Only one state, Maryland, showed improvements in mortality (?1.2%, ?1.7% to ?0.7% per year), while many, concentrated in the south and west, observed disproportionate annual increases: Kentucky 6.8% (5.1% to 8.5%), New Mexico 6.0% (4.1% to 7.9%), Arkansas 5.7% (3.9% to 7.6%), Indiana 5.0% (3.8% to 6.1%), and Alabama 5.0% (3.2% to 6.8%).\n\n No state showed improvements in hepatocellular carcinoma related mortality, while Arizona (5.1%, 3.7% to 6.5%) and Kansas (4.3%, 2.8% to 5.8%) experienced the most severe annual increases.\n\n\nConclusions\nMortality due to cirrhosis has been increasing in the US since 2009.

with comorbidities, but its impact on patients with cirrhosis is currently unknown.\n\n Herein, we aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the clinical outcome of patients with cirrhosis.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this multicentre retrospective study, patients with cirrhosis and a confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were enrolled between 1st and 31th March 2020. Clinical and biochemical data at diagnosis of COVID-19 and at the last outpatient visit were obtained through review of medical records.\n\n\nResults\nFifty patients with cirrhosis and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled (age 67 years, 70% men, 38% virus-related, 52% previously compensated cirrhosis).\n\n At diagnosis, 64% of patients presented fever, 42% shortness of breath/polypnea, 22% encephalopathy, 96% needed hospitalization or a prolonged stay if already in hospital.\n\n Respiratory support was necessary in 71%, 52% received antivirals, 80% heparin.\n\n Serum albumin significantly decreased, while bilirubin, creatinine and prothrombin time significantly increased at COVID-19 diagnosis compared to last available data.\n\n The proportion of patients with a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score ?15 increased from 13% to 26% (p = 0.037), acute-on-chronic liver failure and de novo acute liver injury occurred in 14 (28%) and 10 patients, respectively.\n\n Seventeen patients died after a median of 10 (4–13) days from COVID-19 diagnosis, with a 30-day-mortality rate of 34%.\n\n The severity of lung and liver (according to CLIF-C, CLIF-OF and MELD scores) diseases independently predicted mortality.\n\n In patients with cirrhosis, mortality was significantly higher in those with COVID-19 than in those hospitalized for bacterial infections.\n\n\nConclusion\nCOVID-19 is associated with liver function deterioration and elevated mortality in patients with cirrhosis.\n\n\nLay summary\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a major health threat to healthy individuals and those with comorbidities.\n\n Herein, we assessed its impact on patients with cirrhosis.\n\n Infection with COVID-19 was associated with liver function deterioration and elevated mortality in patients with cirrhosis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7280108","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Massimo","surname":"Iavarone","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Roberta","surname":"D'Ambrosio","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alessandro","surname":"Soria","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michela","surname":"Triolo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nicola","surname":"Pugliese","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paolo","surname":"Del Poggio","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Giovanni","surname":"Perricone","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sara","surname":"Massironi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Angiola","surname":"Spinetti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elisabetta","surname":"Buscarini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mauro","surname":"Viganò","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Canio","surname":"Carriero","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stefano","surname":"Fagiuoli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alessio","surname":"Aghemo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Luca S.","surname":"Belli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Martina","surname":"Lucà","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marianna","surname":"Pedaci","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alessandro","surname":"Rimondi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maria Grazia","surname":"Rumi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pietro","surname":"Invernizzi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paolo","surname":"Bonfanti","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pietro","surname":"Lampertico","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/gutjnl-2020-322118","date":"2020-06-24","title":"Comparison of mortality risk in patients with cirrhosis and COVID-19 compared with patients with cirrhosis alone and COVID-19 alone: multicentre matched cohort","abstract":"Objective\nComorbid conditions are associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19. Registry data show that patients with cirrhosis may be at high risk.\n\n However, outcome comparisons among patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 versus patients with COVID-19 alone and cirrhosis alone are lacking.\n\n The aim of this study was to perform these comparisons.\n\n\nDesign\nA multicentre study of inpatients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 compared with age/gender-matched patients with COVID-19 alone and cirrhosis alone was performed.\n\n COVID-19 and cirrhosis characteristics, development of organ failures and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and mortality (inpatient death+hospice) were compared.\n\n\nResults\n37 patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 were matched with 108 patients with COVID-19 and 127 patients with cirrhosis from seven sites.\n\n Race/ethnicity were similar.\n\n Patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 had higher mortality compared with patients with COVID-19 (30% vs 13%, p=0.03) but not between patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 and patients with cirrhosis (30% vs 20%, p=0.16).\n\n Patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 versus patients with COVID-19 alone had equivalent respiratory symptoms, chest findings and rates of intensive care unit transfer and ventilation.\n\n However, patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 had worse Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI 6.5±3.1 vs 3.3±2.5, p&lt;0.001), lower presenting GI symptoms and higher lactate.\n\n Patients with cirrhosis alone had higher cirrhosis-related complications, maximum model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and lower BiPAP/ventilation requirement compared with patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19, but CCI and ACLF rates were similar.\n\n In the entire group, CCI (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.37, p&lt;0.0001) was the only variable predictive of mortality on multivariable regression.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this multicentre North American contemporaneously enrolled study, age/gender-matched patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 had similar mortality compared with patients with cirrhosis alone but higher than patients with COVID-19 alone.\n\n CCI was the only independent mortality predictor in the entire matched cohort.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7371484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jasmohan

Patients were categorized based on their exposure to hydroxychloroquine alone (HC) or with azithromycin (HC+AZ) as treatments in addition to standard supportive management for Covid-19. The two primary outcomes were death and the need for mechanical ventilation.\n\n We determined the association between treatment and the primary outcomes using competing risk hazard regression adjusting for clinical characteristics via propensity scores.\n\n Discharge and death were taken into account as competing risks and subdistribution hazard ratios are presented.\n\n\nRESULTS:\nid='P3'>A total of 368 patients were evaluated (HC, n=97; HC+AZ, n=113; no HC, n=158).\n\n Rates of death in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups were 27.8%, 22.1%, 11.4%, respectively.\n\n Rates of ventilation in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups were 13.3%, 6.9%, 14.1%, respectively.\n\n Compared to the no HC group, the risk of death from any cause was higher in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.10 to 6.17; P=0.03) but not in the HC+AZ group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.56 to 2.32; P=0.72).\n\n The risk of ventilation was similar in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.53 to 3.79; P=0.48) and in the HC+AZ group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.16 to 1.12; P=0.09), compared to the no HC group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nid='P4'>In this study, we found no evidence that use of hydroxychloroquine, either with or without azithromycin, reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with Covid-19. An association of increased overall mortality was identified in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone.\n\n These findings highlight the importance of awaiting the results of ongoing prospective, randomized, controlled studies before widespread adoption of these drugs.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7276049","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Joseph","surname":"Magagnoli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Siddharth","surname":"Narendran","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Felipe","surname":"Pereira","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tammy","surname":"Cummings","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"James W.","surname":"Hardin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S.

The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection.\n\n These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine.\n\n\nLimitation:\nPublicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThis work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS.\n\n Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.\n\n\nPrimary Funding Source:\nU.\n\nS.\n\n Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of General Medical Sciences, and Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7081172","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Stephen A.","surname":"Lauer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kyra H.","surname":"Grantz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qifang","surname":"Bi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Forrest K.","surname":"Jones","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qulu","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hannah R.","surname":"Meredith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrew S.","surname":"Azman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicholas G.","surname":"Reich","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Justin","surname":"Lessler","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.15585/mmwr.mm6915e3","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Hospitalization Rates and Characteristics of Patients Hospitalized with Laboratory-Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 — COVID-NET, 14 States, March 1–30, 2020","abstract":"","id":"PMC7755063","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Shikha","surname":"Garg","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lindsay","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Whitaker","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alissa","surname":"O’Halloran","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Charisse","surname":"Cummings","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rachel","surname":"Holstein","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mila","surname":"Prill","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shua J.","surname":"Chai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pam D.","surname":"Kirley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nisha B.","surname":"Alden","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Breanna","surname":"Kawasaki","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kimberly","surname":"Yousey-Hindes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linda","surname":"Niccolai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Evan J.","surname":"Anderson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kyle P.","surname":"Openo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andrew","surname":"Weigel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maya L.","surname":"Monroe","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Patricia","surname":"Ryan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Justin","surname":"Henderson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sue","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy","surname":"Como-Sabetti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ruth","surname":"Lynfield","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniel","surname":"Sosin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Salina","surname":"Torres","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alison","surname":"Muse","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nancy M.","surname":"Bennett","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laurie","surname":"Billing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Melissa","surname":"Sutton","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicole","surname":"West","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"William","surname":"Schaffner","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"H.
