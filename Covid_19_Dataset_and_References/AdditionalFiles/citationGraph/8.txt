This interaction has been proposed as a potential risk factor in patients treated with RAAS inhibitors.\n\n\nObjectives\nThis study analyzed whether RAAS inhibitors modify the risk for COVID-19.\nMethods\nThe RASTAVI (Renin-Angiotensin System Blockade Benefits in Clinical Evolution and Ventricular Remodeling After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) trial is an ongoing randomized clinical trial randomly allocating subjects to ramipril or control groups after successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement at 14 centers in Spain.\n\n A non-pre-specified interim analysis was performed to evaluate ramipril’s impact on COVID-19 risk in this vulnerable population.\n\n\nResults\nAs of April 1, 2020, 102 patients (50 in the ramipril group and 52 in the control group) were included in the trial.\n\n Mean age was 82.3 ± 6.1 years, 56.9% of the participants were male.\n\n Median time of ramipril treatment was 6 months (interquartile range: 2.9 to 11.4 months).\n\n Eleven patients (10.8%) have been diagnosed with COVID-19 (6 in control group and 5 receiving ramipril; hazard ratio: 1.150; 95% confidence interval: 0.351 to 3.768).\n\n The risk of COVID-19 was increased in older patients (p = 0.019) and those with atrial fibrillation (p = 0.066), lower hematocrit (p = 0.084), and more comorbidities according to Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (p = 0.065).\n\n Admission and oxygen supply was required in 4.9% of patients (2 in the ramipril group and 3 in the control group), and 4 of them died (2 in each randomized group).\n\n A higher body mass index was the only factor increasing the mortality rate (p = 0.039).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn a high-risk population of older patients with cardiovascular disease, randomization to ramipril had no impact on the incidence or severity of COVID-19. This analysis supports the maintenance of RAAS inhibitor treatment during the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n (Renin-Angiotensin System Blockade Benefits in Clinical Evolution and Ventricular Remodeling After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation [RASTAVI]; NCT03201185)\n","id":"PMC7250557","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ignacio J.","surname":"Amat-Santos","email":"ijamat@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Sandra","surname":"Santos-Martinez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Diego","surname":"López-Otero","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Luis","surname":"Nombela-Franco","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Enrique","surname":"Gutiérrez-Ibanes","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Raquel","surname":"Del Valle","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Erika","surname":"Muñoz-García","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Víctor A.","surname":"Jiménez-Diaz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Ander","surname":"Regueiro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Rocío","surname":"González-Ferreiro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Tomás","surname":"Benito","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Xoan Carlos","surname":"Sanmartin-Pena","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Pablo","surname":"Catalá","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Tania","surname":"Rodríguez-Gabella","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Jose Raúl","surname":"Delgado-Arana","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Manuel","surname":"Carrasco-Moraleja","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Borja","surname":"Ibañez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                               J.

four endemic human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43, and -HKU1 contribute a considerable share of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in adults and children.\n While their clinical representation resembles that of many other agents of the common cold, their evolutionary histories, and host associations could provide important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics.\n For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents.\n HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses.\n HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine.\n The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century.\n New data suggest that HCoV-229E may actually be transferred from dromedary camels similar to Middle East

zoonosis that causes death in 35·7% of cases.\n As of Feb 28, 2018, 2182 cases of MERS-CoV infection (with 779 deaths) in 27 countries were reported to WHO worldwide, with most being reported in Saudi Arabia (1807 cases with 705 deaths).\n MERS-CoV features prominently in the WHO blueprint list of priority pathogens that threaten global health security.\n Although primary transmission of MERS-CoV to human beings is linked to exposure to dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius), the exact mode by which MERS-CoV infection is acquired remains undefined.\n Up to 50% of MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia have been classified as secondary, occurring from human-to-human transmission through contact with asymptomatic or symptomatic individuals infected with MERS-CoV.\n Hospital outbreaks of MERS-CoV are a hallmark of MERS-CoV infection.\n The clinical features associated with MERS-CoV infection are not MERS-specific and are similar to other respiratory tract infections.\n Thus, the diagnosis of MERS can easily be missed, unless the doctor or health-care worker has a high degree of clinical awareness and the patient undergoes specific testing for MERS-CoV.\n The largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in South Korea in May, 2015, resulting in 186 cases with 38 deaths.\n This outbreak was caused by a traveller with undiagnosed MERS-CoV infection who became ill after returning to Seoul from a trip to the Middle East.\n The traveller visited several health facilities in South Korea, transmitting the virus to many other individuals long before a diagnosis was made.\n With 10 million pilgrims visiting Saudi Arabia each year from 182 countries, watchful surveillance by public health systems, and a high degree of clinical awareness of the possibility of MERS-CoV infection is essential.\n In this Review, we provide a comprehensive update and synthesis of the latest available data on the epidemiology, determinants, and risk factors of primary, household, and nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV, and suggest measures to reduce risk of transmission.\n","id":"PMC7164784","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"David S","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Esam

them.\n In February 2018, WHO held an informal expert consultation to review and update the list of priority diseases, employing a prioritization methodology which uses the Delphi technique, questionnaires, multi-criteria decision analysis, and expert review to identify relevant diseases.\n The committee determined that, given their potential to cause a public health emergency and the absence of efficacious drugs and/or vaccines, there is an urgent need for accelerated R&amp;D for (in no order of priority) Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus and Marburg virus disease, Lassa fever, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Nipah and henipaviral diseases, Rift Valley fever and Zika virus disease.\n The experts also included

and has no approved antiviral therapy.\n\n We aimed to compare ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a treatment for patients with severe MERS-CoV infection with a supportive therapy only.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective cohort study, we included adults (aged ?16 years) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection and pneumonia needing ventilation support, diagnosed between Oct 23, 2012, and May 1, 2014, at the Prince Sultan Military Medical City (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia).\n\n All patients received appropriate supportive care and regular clinical and laboratory monitoring, but patients diagnosed after Sept 16, 2013, were also given oral ribavirin (dose based on calculated creatinine clearance, for 8–10 days) and subcutaneous pegylated interferon alfa-2a (180 ?g per week for 2 weeks).\n\n The primary endpoint was 14-day and 28-day survival from the date of MERS-CoV infection diagnosis.\n\n We used ?2 and Fischer's exact test to analyse categorical variables and the t test to analyse continuous variables.\n\n\nFindings\nWe analysed 20 patients who received ribavirin and interferon (treatment group; initiated a median of 3 days [range 0–8] after diagnosis) and 24 who did not (comparator group).\n\n Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were similar between groups, apart from baseline absolute neutrophil count, which was significantly lower in the comparator group (5·88?×?109/L [SD 3·95] vs 9·88?×?109/L [6·63]; p=0·023).\n\n 14 (70%) of 20 patients in the treatment group had survived after 14 days, compared with seven (29%) of 24 in the comparator group (p=0·004).\n\n After 28 days, six (30%) of 20 and four (17%) of 24, respectively, had survived (p=0·054).\n\n Adverse effects were similar between groups, apart from reduction in haemoglobin, which was significantly greater in the treatment group than in the comparator group (4·32 g/L [SD 2·47] vs 2·14 g/L [1·90]; p=0·002).\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn patients with severe MERS-CoV infection, ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a therapy is associated with significantly improved survival at 14 days, but not at 28 days.\n\n Further assessment in appropriately designed randomised trials is recommended.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7106357","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ali

published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP yielded a sensitivity of 67·9% and specificity of 78·2% (AUC=0·730).\n\n The addition of eosinopenia alone or the combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP into the guideline-recommended diagnostic parameters for COVID-19 improved the predictive capacity with higher than zero of both net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI).\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP can effectively triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients attending the fever clinic with COVID-19-like initial symptoms.\n\n This finding would be particularly useful for designing triage strategies in an epidemic region having a large number of patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases while limited medical resources for nucleic acid tests and radiographic examination.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7196382","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qilin","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiuli","surname":"Ding","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Geqing","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Heng-Gui","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fenghua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhi","surname":"Geng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Luming","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shijun","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"An","surname":"Pan","email":"panan@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Wang","email":"lin_wang@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng","surname":"Wang","email":"zhengwang@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0950","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Association of cardiac injury with mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017","date":"2020-03-09","title":"Cardiovascular Implications of Fatal Outcomes of Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","abstract":"This case series study evaluates the association of underlying cardiovascular disease and myocardial injury on fatal outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n","id":"PMC7101506","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongzhen","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hairong","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xinghuan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibing","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nSince December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020.

effect of angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 and its effect on the prognosis of COVID?19","abstract":"This article reviews the correlation between angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and severe risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) and the possible mechanisms.\n ACE2 is a crucial component of the renin?angiotensin system (RAS).\n The classical RAS ACE?Ang II?AT1R regulatory axis and the ACE2?Ang 1?7?MasR counter?regulatory axis play an essential role in maintaining homeostasis in humans.\n ACE2 is widely distributed in the heart, kidneys, lungs, and testes.\n ACE2 antagonizes the activation of the classical RAS system and protects against organ damage, protecting against hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.\n Similar to SARS?CoV, SARS?CoV?2 also uses the ACE2 receptor to invade human alveolar epithelial cells.\n Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical high?mortality disease, and ACE2 has a protective effect on this type of acute lung injury.\n Current research shows that the poor prognosis of patients with COVID?19 is related to factors such as sex (male), age (&gt;60 years), underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), secondary ARDS, and other relevant factors.\n Because of these protective effects of ACE2 on chronic underlying diseases and ARDS, the development of spike protein?based vaccine and drugs enhancing ACE2 activity may become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of COVID?19 in the future.\n","id":"PMC7317908","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hao","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Wang","email":"wangyanwang@bjmu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Wang","email":"wangyanwang@bjmu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gui?Qiang","surname":"Wang","email":"john131212@126.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Gui?Qiang","surname":"Wang","email":"john131212@126.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/eurheart/ehaa373","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Circulating

prostate tissues of several patients diagnosed with BPH based on histology, also demonstrated decreased ACE activity and increased immunoreactive ACE protein/ACE activity and ZPHL/HHL ratios, that

cells exposed to angiotensin II (Ang II), leading to endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disorders.\n Since von Willebrand Factor (vWF) blockade improves endothelial function in coronary patients, we hypothesized that targeting endothelial vWF with short interference RNA (siRNA) prevents Ang II-induced ET-1 upregulation.\n Nearly 65?±?2% silencing of vWF in porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAOECs) was achieved with vWF-specific siRNA without affecting cell viability and growth.\n While showing ET-1 similar to wild type cells at rest, vWF-silenced cells did not present ET-1 upregulation during exposure to Ang II (100?nM/24?h), preserving levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity similar to wild type.\n vWF silencing prevented AngII-induced increase in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) activity and superoxide anion (O2?) levels, known triggers of ET-1 expression.\n Moreover, no increase in O2? or ET-1 levels was found in silenced cells treated with AngII or NOX-agonist phorbol ester (PMA 5?nM/48?h).\n Finally, vWF was required for overexpression of NOX4 and NOX2 in response to AngII and PMA.\n In conclusion, endothelial vWF knockdown prevented Ang II-induced ET-1 upregulation through attenuation of NOX-mediated O2? production.\n Our findings reveal a new role of vWF in preventing of Ang II-induced

in the pathophysiology of coronary heart disease.\n The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2-angiotensin-(1–7) [Ang (1–7)]-Mas receptor (MasR) axis is a key regulator in myocardial remodeling and development of heart failure.\n To investigate how ACE2-Ang-(1–7)-MasR axis function on myocardial remodeling and cardiac fibrosis in post-myocardial infarction (MI), male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight, 200±20 g) were used to establish the model of myocardial infarction by ligating the left coronary artery.\n The present study suggests that telmisartan (Tel) and olmesartan (Olm) (5 mg/kg/d) can inhibit myocardial remodeling of post-myocardial infarction through the ACE2-Ang (1–7)-MasR pathway.\n Administration of Tel or Olm was demonstrated to significantly inhibit collagen deposition using Masson staining.\n In addition, telmisartan and olmesartan was indicated to antagonize angiotensin II (Ang II) and upregulate ACE2, MasR, Ang (1–7) expression in myocardial tissue using immunoassay and ELISA test, and the effect of Olm was more marked than that of Tel at the same dosage.\n Simultaneously, compared with the MI or Sham group, the mRNA and protein expression of ACE2, Ang II and MasR in myocardial tissue demonstrated a remarkable increase in the Olm group, when compared with the Tel group.\n Taken together, our data demonstrated that ACE2-Ang (1–7)-MasR axis may present a potential protective role in the development of myocardial remodeling and may provide a new target for drug development of cardiac fibrosis.\n In conclusion, Olm is superior to Tel in inhibiting myocardial local Ang II level reducing myocardial collagen deposition and improving myocardial remodeling by upregulating the expression of ACE2, Ang (1–7) and

infection","abstract":"Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors mediate the entry into the cell of three strains of coronavirus: SARS-CoV, NL63 and SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous and widely expressed in the heart, vessels, gut, lung (particularly in type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages), kidney, testis and brain.\n ACE2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form.\n An important salutary function of membrane-bound and soluble ACE2 is the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin1-7.\n Consequently, ACE2 receptors limit several detrimental effects resulting from binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptors, which include vasoconstriction, enhanced inflammation and thrombosis.\n The increased generation of angiotensin1-7 also triggers counter-regulatory protective effects through binding to G-protein coupled Mas receptors.\n Unfortunately, the entry of SARS-CoV2 into the cells through membrane fusion markedly down-regulates ACE2 receptors, with loss of the catalytic effect of these receptors at the external site of the membrane.\n Increased pulmonary inflammation and coagulation have been reported as unwanted effects of enhanced and unopposed angiotensin II effects via the ACE?Angiotensin II?AT1 receptor axis.\n Clinical reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show that several features associated with infection and severity of the disease (i.\ne.\n, older age, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) share a variable degree of ACE2 deficiency.\n We suggest that ACE2 down-regulation induced by viral invasion may be especially detrimental in people with baseline ACE2 deficiency associated with the above conditions.\n The additional ACE2 deficiency after viral invasion might amplify the dysregulation between the ‘adverse’ ACE?Angiotensin II?AT1 receptor axis and the ‘protective’ ACE2?Angiotensin1-7?Mas receptor axis.\n In the lungs, such dysregulation would favor the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes triggered by local angiotensin II hyperactivity unopposed by angiotensin1-7.\n In this setting, recombinant ACE2, angiotensin1-7 and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers could be promising therapeutic approaches in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n","id":"PMC7167588","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Paolo","surname":"Verdecchia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Claudio","surname":"Cavallini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Antonio","surname":"Spanevello","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fabio","surname":"Angeli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.yexmp.2019.104350","date":"1970-01-01","title":"ACE2

severe cases resulted in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a severe form of acute lung injury (ALI) that further contributes to morbidity.\n To date, no effective drugs that improve the clinical outcome of influenza A (H7N9) virus-infected patients have been identified.\n Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 are involved in several pathologies such as cardiovascular functions, renal disease, and acute lung injury.\n In the current study, we report that ACE2 could mediate the severe acute lung injury induced by influenza A (H7N9) virus infection in an experimental mouse model.\n Moreover, ACE2 deficiency worsened the disease pathogenesis markedly, mainly by targeting the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1).\n The current findings demonstrate that ACE2 plays a critical role in influenza A (H7N9) virus-induced acute lung injury, and suggest that might be a useful potential therapeutic target for future influenza A (H7N9)

in heart failure and hypertensive heart disease.\n\n They may be similarly beneficial in patients with aortic stenosis (AS), but historical safety concerns have limited their use, and no prospective clinical trials exist.\n\n\nMethods and results\nWe conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 100 patients with moderate or severe asymptomatic AS to examine the physiological effects of ramipril, particularly LV mass (LVM) regression.\n\n Subjects were randomized to ramipril 10 mg daily (n = 50) or placebo (n = 50) for 1 year, and underwent cardiac magnetic resonance, echocardiography, and exercise testing at 0, 6, and 12 months, with follow-up data available in 77 patients.\n\n There was a modest but progressive reduction in LVM (the primary end point) in the ramipril group vs.\n\n the placebo group (mean change ?3.9 vs.\n\n +4.5 g, respectively, P = 0.0057).\n\n There were also trends towards improvements in myocardial physiology: the ramipril group showed preserved tissue Doppler systolic velocity compared with placebo (+0.0 vs.\n\n ?0.5 cm/s, P = 0.04), and a slower rate of progression of the AS (valve area 0.0 cm2 in the ramipril group vs.\n\n ?0.2 cm2 in the placebo arm, P = 0.067).\n\n There were no significant differences in major adverse cardiac events.\n\n\nConclusion\nACE inhibition leads to a modest, but progressive reduction in LVM in asymptomatic patients with moderate–severe AS compared with placebo, with trends towards improvements in myocardial physiology and slower progression of valvular stenosis.\n\n A larger clinical outcome trial to confirm these findings and explore their clinical relevance is required.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4505792","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sacha","surname":"Bull","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Margaret","surname":"Loudon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jane

Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV.\n One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models of viruses.\n Based on the sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV.\n This study provides a robust test of this reiterative framework,

By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity.\n In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality.\n Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients.\n Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.\n Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7187729","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xinhui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotian","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020.

2019 (Covid-19) has not been well studied.\n\n\nMethods\nWe carried out a population-based case–control study in the Lombardy region of Italy.\n\n A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients’ clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAmong both case patients and controls, the mean (±SD) age was 68±13 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile.\n\n Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.86 to 1.05] for ARBs and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07] for ACE inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10] for ARBs and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21] for ACE inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this large, population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease.\n\n However, there was no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARBs affected the risk of

inhibitors might influence the severity of COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate whether continuing versus discontinuing renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) affects outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nMethods\nThe REPLACE COVID trial was a prospective, randomised, open-label trial done at 20 large referral hospitals in seven countries worldwide.\n\n Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor before admission.\n\n Individuals with contraindications to continuation or discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their renin–angiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system.\n\n The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan dysfunction during the hospitalisation.\n\n Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n The REPLACE COVID trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov,

the occurrence of severe and fatal COVID?19 in infected hypertensive patients who were under treatment with angiotensin?converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) vs no treatment or other antihypertensives was conducted.\n\n\nMethods\nPubMed, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Library, medRxiv and bioRxiv were searched for relevant studies.\n\n Fixed?effects models or random?effects models were used depending on the heterogeneity between estimates.\n\n\nResults and discussion\nA total of eighteen studies with 17 311 patients were included.\n\n The use of RAS inhibitors was associated with a significant 16% decreased risk of the composite outcome (death, admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation requirement or progression to severe or

We developed a machine learning classifier to identify “sick posts,” in which users report their own or other people’s symptoms and diagnoses related to COVID-19. Using officially reported case counts as the outcome, we then estimated the Granger causality of sick posts and other COVID-19 posts on daily case counts.\n\n For a subset of geotagged posts (3.10% of all retrieved posts), we also ran separate predictive models for Hubei province, the epicenter of the initial outbreak, and the rest of mainland China.\n\n\nResults\nWe found that reports of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 significantly predicted daily case counts up to 14 days ahead of official statistics, whereas other COVID-19 posts did not have similar predictive power.\n\n For the subset of geotagged posts, we found that the predictive pattern held true for both Hubei province and the rest of mainland China regardless of the unequal distribution of health care resources and the outbreak timeline.\n\n\nConclusions\nPublic social media data can be usefully harnessed to predict infection cases and inform timely responses.\n\n Researchers and disease control agencies should pay close attention to the social media infosphere regarding COVID-19.

As of May 6, 2020, 84,407 cases and 4643 deaths have been confirmed in China.\n\n The Chinese population has expressed great concern since the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n Meanwhile, an average of 1 billion people per day are using the Baidu search engine to find COVID-19–related health information.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this paper is to analyze web search data volumes related to COVID-19 in China.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted an infodemiological study to analyze web search data volumes related to COVID-19. Using Baidu Index data, we assessed the search frequencies of specific search terms in Baidu to describe the impact of COVID-19 on public health, psychology, behaviors, lifestyles, and social policies (from February 11, 2020, to March 17, 2020).\n\n\nResults\nThe search frequency related to COVID-19 has increased significantly since February 11th.\n\n Our heat maps demonstrate that citizens in Wuhan, Hubei Province, express more concern about COVID-19 than citizens from other cities since the outbreak first occurred in Wuhan.\n\n Wuhan citizens frequently searched for content related to “medical help,” “protective materials,” and “pandemic progress.\n\n” Web searches for “return to work” and “go back to school” have increased eight-fold compared to the previous month.\n\n Searches for content related to “closed community and remote office” have continued to rise, and searches for “remote office demand” have risen by 663% from the previous quarter.\n\n Employees who have returned to work have mainly engaged in the following web searches: “return to work and prevention measures,” “return to work guarantee policy,” and “time to return to work.\n\n” Provinces with large, educated populations (eg, Henan, Hebei, and Shandong) have been focusing on “online education” whereas medium-sized cities have been paying more attention to “online medical care.\n\n”\nConclusions\nOur findings suggest that web search data may reflect changes in health literacy, social panic, and prevention and control policies in response to COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7333795","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michelle","surname":"Manning Hutson","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Michelle","surname":"Manning Hutson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dinesh","surname":"Gunasekeran","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Olivia","surname":"Keiser","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chenjie","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Chenjie","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xinyu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xinyu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaogang","surname":"Wang","email":"wangyg@tmu.edu.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yaogang","surname":"Wang","email":"wangyg@tmu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1053/j.jrn.2020.03.006","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Impact of Nutrition and Diet on COVID-19 Infection and Implications for Kidney Health and Kidney Disease Management","abstract":"","id":"PMC7186539","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kamyar","surname":"Kalantar-Zadeh","email":"kkz@uci.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Linda W.","surname":"Moore","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Linda W.","surname":"Moore","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/0141076820921107","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Protecting older people from COVID-19: should the United Kingdom\nstart at age 60?","abstract":"","id":"PMC7366331","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tasnime","surname":"Osama","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bharat","surname":"Pankhania","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Azeem","surname":"Majeed","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.2196/19636","date":"2020-06-15","title":"Identification of Symptoms Prognostic of COVID-19 Severity: Multivariate Data Analysis of a Case Series in Henan Province","abstract":"Background\nThe outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has been declared a global pandemic.\n\n Identifying individuals whose infection can potentially become severe is critical to control the case fatality rate of COVID-19. However, knowledge of symptoms that are prognostic of COVID-19 severity is lacking.\n\n\nObjective\nThe objective of our study was to identify symptoms prognostic of COVID-19 infection severity.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analyzed documented symptoms, including fever, cough, fatigue, expectoration, sore throat, chest distress, headache, diarrhea, rhinorrhea, stuffed nose, nausea, vomiting, muscle or joint ache, shortness of breath, and their associations with disease severity using a case series, including 655 confirmed cases from January 23 to February 5, 2020 in Henan Province, China.\n\n We also analyzed the influence of individual characteristics, including age, gender, and comorbidities, on symptoms with prognostic value.\n\n\nResults\nFatigue (95% CI 0.141 to 0.334, P&lt;.\n\n001), expectoration (95% CI 0.107 to 0.305, P&lt;.\n\n001) and stuffed nose (95% CI –0.499 to –0.082, P=.\n\n006) were identified as the prognostic symptoms of COVID-19 patients from the multivariate analysis.\n\n Fever occurred in 603/655 (92.1%) of the patients but was not associated with disease severity.\n\n Fatigue accounted for 184/655 (28.1%) of the patients and was linearly associated with infection severity with statistical significance.\n\n Expectoration occurred in 169/655 (25.8%) patients in the cohort and was the sole prognostic factor for patients with cardiovascular complications, including hypertension.\n\n Shortness of breath, chest distress, muscle or joint ache, and dry cough, which occurred in 33 (5%), 83 (12.7%), 78 (11.9%), and 276 (42.1%) of the 655 patients, respectively, were significantly enriched among patients classified as severe.\n\n Stuffed nose and nausea were associated with favorable disease severity, especially among male patients.\n\n More female than male patients were documented as having muscle or joint ache.\n\n Headache was most enriched in patents aged 15 to 39 years, followed by those aged 40 to 64 years, with statistical significance.\n\n\nConclusions\nFatigue and expectoration are signs of severe COVID-19 infection.\n\n Shortness of breath, chest distress, muscle or joint ache, and dry cough are prevalent in severe patients.\n\n Expectoration is commonly present in older individuals and patients with cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension.\n\n Shortness of breath is prognostic of severe infection in male patients.\n\n Stuffed nose and nausea are favorable prognostic factors of severe infection, especially among male

the innate immune system and impairs adaptive immunity, leading to chronic inflammation and impaired host defense against viruses.\n Furthermore, peripheral inflammation caused by COVID-19 may have long-term consequences in those that recover, leading to chronic medical conditions such as dementia and neurodegenerative disease, likely through neuroinflammatory mechanisms that can be compounded by an unhealthy diet.\n Thus, now more than ever, wider access to healthy foods should be a top priority and individuals should be mindful of healthy eating habits to reduce susceptibility to and

disease (COVID-19) has caused a pneumonia epidemic that began in Wuhan, China, and is rapidly spreading throughout the whole world.\n\n Italy is the hardest hit country after China.\n\n Considering the deleterious consequences of malnutrition, which certainly can affect patients with COVID-19, the aim of this article is to present a pragmatic protocol for early nutritional supplementation of non-critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19 disease.\n\n It is based on the observation that most patients present at admission with severe inflammation and anorexia leading to a drastic reduction of food intake, and that a substantial percentage develops respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation or even continuous positive airway pressure.\n\n\nMethods\nHigh-calorie dense diets in a variety of different consistencies with highly digestible foods and snacks are available for all patients.\n\n Oral supplementation of whey proteins as well as intravenous infusion of multivitamin, multimineral trace elements solutions are implemented at admission.\n\n In the presence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficit, cholecalciferol is promptly supplied.\n\n If nutritional risk is detected, two to three bottles of protein-calorie oral nutritional supplements (ONS) are provided.\n\n If &lt;2 bottles/d of ONS are consumed for 2 consecutive days and/or respiratory conditions are worsening, supplemental/total parenteral nutrition is prescribed.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe are aware that our straight approach may be debatable.\n\n However, to cope with the current emergency crisis, its aim is to promptly and pragmatically implement nutritional care in patients with COVID-19, which might be overlooked despite being potentially beneficial to clinical outcomes and effective in preventing the consequences of malnutrition in this patient

for non-communicable diseases (NCDs); however, its impact on the burden of NCDs has not been systematically evaluated.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the consumption of major foods and nutrients across 195 countries and to quantify the impact of their suboptimal intake on NCD mortality and morbidity.\n\n\nMethods\nBy use of a comparative risk assessment approach, we estimated the proportion of disease-specific burden attributable to each dietary risk factor (also referred to as population attributable fraction) among adults aged 25 years or older.\n\n The main inputs to this analysis included the intake of each dietary factor, the effect size of the dietary factor on disease endpoint, and the level of intake associated with the lowest risk of mortality.\n\n Then, by use of disease-specific population attributable fractions, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), we calculated the number of deaths and DALYs attributable to diet for each disease outcome.\n\n\nFindings\nIn 2017, 11 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 10–12) deaths and 255 million (234–274) DALYs were attributable to dietary risk factors.\n\n High intake of sodium (3 million [1–5] deaths and 70 million [34–118] DALYs), low intake of whole grains (3 million [2–4] deaths and 82 million [59–109] DALYs), and low intake of fruits (2 million [1–4] deaths and 65 million [41–92] DALYs) were the leading dietary risk factors for deaths and DALYs globally and in many countries.\n\n Dietary data were from mixed sources and were not available for all countries, increasing the statistical uncertainty of our estimates.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThis study provides a comprehensive picture of the potential impact of suboptimal diet on NCD mortality and morbidity, highlighting the need for improving diet across nations.\n\n Our findings will inform implementation of evidence-based dietary interventions and provide a platform for evaluation of their impact on human health

a selected chronic disease, and the relationships between modifiable lifestyle risk factors and age to first of six chronic diseases.\n\n\nMethods\nOntario respondents from 2001 to 2010 of the Canadian Community Health Survey were followed up with administrative data until 2014 for congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive respiratory disease, diabetes, lung cancer, myocardial infarction and stroke.\n\n By sex, the cumulative incidence function of age to first chronic disease was calculated for the six chronic diseases individually and compositely.\n\n The associations between modifiable lifestyle risk factors (alcohol, body mass index, smoking, diet, physical inactivity) and age to first chronic disease were estimated using cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models and Fine-Gray competing risk models.\n\n\nResults\nDiabetes was the most common disease.\n\n By age 70.5?years (2015 world life expectancy), 50.9% of females and 58.1% of males had at least one disease and few had a death free of the selected diseases (3.4% females; 5.4% males).\n\n Of the lifestyle factors, heavy smoking had the strongest association with the risk of experiencing at least one chronic disease (cause-specific hazard ratio?=?3.86; 95% confidence interval?=?3.46, 4.31).\n\n The lifestyle factors were modelled for each disease separately, and the associations varied by chronic disease and sex.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe found that most individuals will have at least one of the six chronic diseases before dying.\n\n This study provides a novel approach using competing risk

Every center also recruited at a 1:1 ratio untreated control subjects matched for age and sex.\n\n All patients had pneumonia and exhibited oxygen saturation &lt;95% when breathing ambient air or when receiving oxygen support.\n\n The primary end points were discharge from the hospital/death and improvement of clinical outcomes, defined as an increase in at least two points on a seven-category modified ordinal scale.\n\n Data were collected retrospectively from patients receiving sitagliptin from 1 March through 30 April 2020.\nRESULTS\nOf the 338 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes and COVID-19 admitted in Northern Italy hospitals included in this study, 169 were on sitagliptin, while 169 were on standard of care.\n\n Treatment with sitagliptin at the time of hospitalization was associated with reduced mortality (18% vs.\n\n 37% of deceased patients;

(ii) the supply of energy to infectious bacteria; (iii) the inflammatory response; and (iv) oxidative stress as a result of bacterial proliferative metabolism.\n Consistent with this evidence, some bacterial infections are typical (and/or have a worse prognosis) in patients with hypercaloric diets and a stressful lifestyle (conditions that promote hyperglycemic episodes).\n On this basis, the present review is particularly focused on: (i) the role of diabetes in the development of some bacterial and viral infections by analyzing preclinical and clinical findings;

Many factors have been associated with both altered ACE2 expression and COVID?19 severity and progression, including age, sex, ethnicity, medication, and several co?morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome.\n Although ACE2 is widely distributed in various human tissues and many of its determinants have been well recognised, ACE2?expressing organs do not equally participate in COVID?19 pathophysiology, implying that other mechanisms are involved in orchestrating cellular infection resulting in tissue damage.\n Reports of pathologic findings in tissue specimens of COVID?19 patients are rapidly emerging and confirm the established role of ACE2 expression and activity in disease pathogenesis.\n Identifying pathologic changes caused by SARS?CoV?2 infection is crucially important as it has major implications for understanding COVID?19 pathophysiology and the development of evidence?based treatment strategies.\n Currently, many interventional strategies are being explored in ongoing clinical trials, encompassing many drug classes and strategies, including antiviral drugs, biological response modifiers, and RAAS inhibitors.\n Ultimately, prevention is key to combat COVID?19 and appropriate measures are being taken accordingly, including development of effective vaccines.\n In this review, we describe the role of ACE2 in COVID?19 pathophysiology, including factors influencing ACE2 expression and activity in relation to COVID?19 severity.\n In addition, we discuss the relevant pathological changes resulting from SARS?CoV?2 infection.\n Finally,

respiratory physiology because increased intra-abdominal adipose tissue can interfere with lung expansion, resulting in reduced lung compliance.\n Further, fat accumulation in the soft tissue of the pharynx can increase inspiratory resistance, and obesity may be associated with sleep apnea.\n Obesity is associated with several defects in cell-mediated immunity, including increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.\n Impaired adipocyte-mediated immune function results in chronically high leptin levels, low adiponectin levels, and anti-inflammatory adipokines.\n Reduced physical activity can impair several steps of the immune response to viruses.\n Obesity also promotes a hypercoagulable state, leading to severe consequences.\n These factors may synergistically play a role in

Patients with worst outcomes and higher mortality are reported to include immunocompromised subjects, namely older adults and polymorbid individuals and malnourished people in general.\n ICU stay, polymorbidity and older age are all commonly associated with high risk for malnutrition, representing per se a relevant risk factor for higher morbidity and mortality in chronic and acute disease.\n

The clear common thread among the top risk groups—vitamin D deficiency—may be being overlooked because of previous overstated claims of vitamin D benefits.\n However, the need to decrease COVID-19 fatalities among high-risk populations is urgent.\n Early researchers reported three striking patterns.\n Firstly, the innate immune system is impaired by vitamin D deficiency, which would predispose sufferers to viral infections such as COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency also increases the activity of the X-chromosome-linked “Renin-Angiotensin” System, making vitamin D deficient individuals (especially men) more susceptible to COVID-19's deadly “cytokine storm” (dramatic immune system overreaction).\n Secondly, the groups who are at highest risk for severe COVID-19 match those who are at highest risk for severe vitamin D deficiency.\n This includes the elderly, men, ethnic groups whose skin is naturally rich in melanin (if living outside the tropics), those who avoid sun exposure for cultural and health reasons, those who live in institutions, the obese, and/or those who suffer with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes.\n And thirdly, the pattern of geographical spread of COVID-19 reflects higher population vitamin D deficiency.\n Both within the USA and throughout the world, COVID-19 fatality rates parallel vitamin D deficiency rates.\n A literature search was performed on PubMed, Google Scholar, and RSMLDS, with targeted Google searches providing additional sources.\n Although randomized controlled trial results may be available eventually, the correlational and causal study evidence supporting a link between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 risks is already so strong that it supports action.\n The 141 author groups writing primarily about biological plausibility detailed how vitamin D deficiency can explain every risk factor and every complication of COVID-19, but agreed that other factors are undoubtedly at work.\n COVID-19 was compared with dengue fever, for which oral vitamin D supplements of 4,000 IU for 10 days were significantly more effective than 1,000 IU in reducing virus replication and controlling the “cytokine storm” (dramatic immune system over-reaction) responsible for fatalities.\n Among the 47 original research studies summarized here, chart reviews found that serum vitamin D levels predicted COVID-19 mortality rates (16 studies) and linearly predicted COVID-19 illness severity (8 studies).\n Two causal modeling studies and several analyses of variance strongly supported the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency is a causal, rather than a bystander, factor in COVID-19 outcomes.\n Three of the four studies whose findings opposed the hypothesis relied upon disproven assumptions.\n The literature review also found that prophylactically correcting possible vitamin D deficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic is extremely safe.\n Widely recommending 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily for all populations with limited ability to manufacture vitamin D from the sun has virtually no potential for harm and is reasonably likely to save many lives.\n","id":"PMC7513835","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Linda L.","surname":"Benskin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajic.2020.06.193","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID-19 fatalities, latitude, sunlight, and vitamin D","abstract":"Background\nSince Vitamin D is known to be vital in regulating the immune system, and sunlight UV radiation exposure on the skin produces Vitamin D and UV intensity is highest nearest the equator, a study was done to examine the correlation between the latitude and COVID-19 fatality rates for countries.\n\n\nMethods\nEighty-eight countries were selected based on their likelihood of providing reliable data.\n\n Using death rates/million for each country from the “worldometer” website, a correlation analysis was done between death rates and a country's latitude.\n\n\nResults\nA highly significant, positive correlation was found between lower death rates and a country's proximity to the equator (Pearson r?=?0.40 P &lt;

25-hydroxyvitamin D and other metabolites, including 1,25(OH)2D, the ligand for the vitamin D receptor (VDR).\n The effects of the vitamin D endocrine system on bone and its growth plate are primarily indirect and mediated by its effect on intestinal calcium transport and serum calcium and phosphate homeostasis.\n Rickets and osteomalacia can be prevented by daily supplements of 400 IU of vitamin D.\n Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;50 nmol/L) accelerates bone turnover, bone loss, and osteoporotic fractures.\n These risks can be reduced by 800 IU of vitamin D together with an appropriate calcium intake, given to institutionalized or vitamin D–deficient elderly subjects.\n VDR and vitamin D metabolic enzymes are widely expressed.\n Numerous genetic, molecular, cellular, and animal studies strongly suggest that vitamin D signaling has many extraskeletal effects.\n These include regulation of cell proliferation, immune and muscle function, skin differentiation, and reproduction, as well as vascular and metabolic properties.\n From observational studies in human subjects, poor vitamin D status is associated with nearly all diseases predicted by these extraskeletal actions.\n Results of randomized controlled trials and Mendelian randomization studies are supportive of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the incidence of some diseases, but, globally, conclusions are mixed.\n These findings point to a need for continued ongoing and future basic and clinical studies to better define whether vitamin D status can be optimized to improve many aspects of human health.\n Vitamin D deficiency enhances the risk of osteoporotic fractures and is associated with many diseases.\n We review what is established and what is plausible regarding the health effects of vitamin D.\n","id":"PMC6626501","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Roger","surname":"Bouillon","email":"roger.bouillon@kuleuven.be","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Claudio","surname":"Marcocci","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Claudio","surname":"Marcocci","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Geert","surname":"Carmeliet","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Geert","surname":"Carmeliet","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniel","surname":"Bikle","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Daniel","surname":"Bikle","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"John

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

Inhibition of TMPRSS2 may work to block or decrease the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\n Intriguingly, TMPRSS2 is an androgen-regulated gene that is up-regulated in prostate cancer where it supports tumor progression and is involved in a frequent genetic translocation with the ERG gene.\n\n First- or second-generation androgen-deprivation therapies (ADTs) decrease the levels of TMPRSS2. Here we put forward the hypothesis that ADTs may protect patients affected by prostate cancer from SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nWe extracted data regarding 9280 patients (4532 males) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 68 hospitals in Veneto, one of the Italian regions that was most affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\n The parameters used for each COVID-19-positive patient were sex, hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit, death, tumor diagnosis, prostate cancer diagnosis, and ADT.\n\n\nResults\nThere were evaluable 9280 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in Veneto on 1 April 2020.

Since previous reports suggested that viral entry into cells may involve angiotensin converting enzyme 2, there has been growing concern that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) use may exacerbate the disease severity.\n\n In this retrospective, single-center US study of adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19, we evaluated the association of ACEI/ARB use with hospital admission.\n\n Secondary outcomes included: ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, use of inotropes, and all-cause mortality.\n\n Propensity score matching was performed to account for potential confounders.\n\n Among 590 unmatched patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 78 patients were receiving ACEI/ARB (median age 63 years and 59.7% male) and 512 patients were non-users (median age 42 years and 47.1% male).\n\n In the propensity matched population, multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities demonstrated that ACEI/ARB use was not associated with hospital admission (OR 1.2, 95%CI 0.5 to 2.7, p?=?0.652).\n\n CAD and CKD/end stage renal disease [ESRD] remained independently associated with admission to hospital.\n\n All-cause mortality, ICU stay, need for ventilation, and inotrope use was not significantly different between the 2 study groups.\n\n In conclusion, among patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19, ACEI/ARB use was not associated with increased risk of hospital admission.\n\n","id":"PMC7354276","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"David J.","surname":"Bae","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" David M.","surname":"Tehrani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Soniya V.","surname":"Rabadia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Marlene","surname":"Frost","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Rushi V.","surname":"Parikh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Marcella","surname":"Calfon-Press","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Olcay","surname":"Aksoy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Soban","surname":"Umar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Reza","surname":"Ardehali","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Amir","surname":"Rabbani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Pooya","surname":"Bokhoor","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Ali","surname":"Nsair","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Jesse","surname":"Currier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Jonathan","surname":"Tobis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Gregg C.","surname":"Fonarow","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Ravi","surname":"Dave","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                               Asim M.","surname":"Rafique","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References":[{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30183-5","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41);

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward C.","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.micinf.2020.01.003","date":"2020-01-24","title":"Measures for diagnosing and treating infections by a novel coronavirus responsible for a pneumonia outbreak originating in Wuhan, China","abstract":"On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City in central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n As of 24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 26 deaths, reported in China and other countries.\n Therefore, combating this new virus and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency.\n Here, we focus on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection.\n","id":"PMC7102556","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lanying","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David M.","surname":"Ojcius","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chungen","surname":"Pan","email":"chungenp@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shibo","surname":"Jiang","email":"shibojiang@fudan.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1164/rccm.2014P7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Novel Wuhan (2019-nCoV) coronavirus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.78.15.7863-7866.2004","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus phylogeny: toward consensus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia (trial version 7) [J / OL].

P?&lt;?.\n01) was negatively correlated with the CT severity scores.\n The receiver?operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve of CRP on the first visit for predicting severe COVID?19 was 0.87 (95% CI 0.10–1.00) at 20.42 mg/L cut?off, with sensitivity and specificity 83% and 91%, respectively.\n CRP in severe COVID?19 patients increased significantly at the initial stage, before CT findings.\n Importantly, CRP, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe COVID?19.","id":"PMC7262341","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaochao","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fengxia","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qionghui","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xixin","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaosong","surname":"Li","email":"lxsong0308@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100375","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: A retrospective case-control study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a pandemic affecting over 200 countries.\n\n Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms.\n\n However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time.\n\n We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21. Based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were divided into two groups: SARS-CoV-2-positive patients as cases and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients as controls.\n\n We compared the clinical features and laboratory findings of the two groups, and analyzed the diagnostic performance of several laboratory parameters in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection and made relevant comparisons to the China diagnosis guideline of having a normal or decreased number of leukocytes (?9·5 109/L) or lymphopenia (&lt;1·1 109/L).\n\n\nFindings\nNormal or decreased number of leukocytes (?9·5 109/L), lymphopenia (&lt;1·1 109/L), eosinopenia (&lt;0·02 109/L), and elevated hs-CRP (?4 mg/L) were presented in 95·0%, 52·2%, 74·7% and 86·7% of COVID-19 patients, much higher than 87·2%, 28·8%, 31·3% and 45·2% of the controls, respectively.\n\n The eosinopenia produced a sensitivity of 74·7% and specificity of 68·7% for separating the two groups with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0·717.

By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity.\n In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality.\n Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients.\n Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.\n Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7187729","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xinhui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotian","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the

2019 (Covid-19) has not been well studied.\n\n\nMethods\nWe carried out a population-based case–control study in the Lombardy region of Italy.\n\n A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients’ clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAmong both case patients and controls, the mean (±SD) age was 68±13 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile.\n\n Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.86 to 1.05] for ARBs and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07] for ACE inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10] for ARBs and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21] for ACE inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this large, population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease.\n\n However, there was no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARBs affected the risk of

inhibitors might influence the severity of COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate whether continuing versus discontinuing renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) affects outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nMethods\nThe REPLACE COVID trial was a prospective, randomised, open-label trial done at 20 large referral hospitals in seven countries worldwide.\n\n Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor before admission.\n\n Individuals with contraindications to continuation or discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their renin–angiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system.\n\n The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan dysfunction during the hospitalisation.\n\n Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n The REPLACE COVID trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04338009.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween March 31 and Aug 20, 2020, 152 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either continue or discontinue renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy (continuation group n=75; discontinuation group n=77).\n\n Mean age of participants was 62 years (SD 12), 68 (45%) were female, mean body-mass index was 33 kg/m2 (SD 8), and 79 (52%) had diabetes.\n\n Compared with discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, continuation had no effect on the global rank score (median rank 73 [IQR 40–110] for continuation vs 81 [38–117] for discontinuation; ?-coefficient 8 [95% CI ?13 to 29]).\n\n There were 16 (21%) of 75 participants in the continuation arm versus 14 (18%) of 77 in the discontinuation arm who required intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation, and 11 (15%) of 75 participants in the continuation group versus ten (13%) of 77 in the discontinuation group died.\n\n 29 (39%) participants in the continuation group and 28 (36%) participants in the discontinuation group had at least one adverse event (?2 test of adverse events between treatment groups p=0·77).\n\n There was no difference in

enzyme 2, which can be upregulated by inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS).\n\n We aimed to test our hypothesis that discontinuation of chronic treatment with ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) mitigates the course o\f recent-onset COVID-19.\nMethods\nACEI-COVID was a parallel group, randomised, controlled, open-label trial done at 35 centres in Austria and Germany.\n\n Patients aged 18 years and older were enrolled if they presented with recent symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and were chronically treated with ACEIs or ARBs.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to discontinuation or continuation of RAS inhibition for 30 days.\n\n Primary outcome was the maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score within 30 days, where death was scored with the maximum achievable SOFA score.\n\n Secondary endpoints were area under the death-adjusted SOFA score (AUCSOFA), mean SOFA score, admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, and death.\n\n Analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis.\n\n This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04353596.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween April 20, 2020, and Jan 20, 2021, 204 patients (median age 75 years [IQR 66–80], 37% females) were randomly assigned to discontinue (n=104) or continue (n=100) RAS inhibition.\n\n Within 30 days, eight (8%) of 104 died in the discontinuation group and 12 (12%) of 100 patients died in the continuation group (p=0·42).\n\n There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between the discontinuation and continuation group (median [IQR] maximum SOFA score 0·00 (0·00–2·00) vs 1·00 (0·00–3·00); p=0·12).\n\n Discontinuation was associated with a significantly lower AUCSOFA (0·00 [0·00–9·25] vs 3·50 [0·00–23·50]; p=0·040), mean SOFA score (0·00 [0·00–0·31] vs 0·12 [0·00–0·78]; p=0·040), and 30-day SOFA score (0·00 [10–90th percentile, 0·00–1·20] vs 0·00 [0·00–24·00]; p=0·023).\n\n At 30 days, 11 (11%) in the discontinuation group and 23 (23%) in the continuation group had signs of organ dysfunction (SOFA score ?1) or were dead (p=0·017).\n\n There were no

Using data from 228,722 Veterans with a history of hypertension who received COVID-19 testing at the VA, we investigated whether the use of ACEI or ARB over the two years prior to the index date was associated with increased odds of (1) a positive COVID-19 test, and (2) a severe outcome (hospitalization, mortality, and use of intensive care unit (ICU) and/or mechanical ventilation) among COVID-19-positive patients.\n\n We used logistic regression with and without propensity score weighting (PSW) to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the association between ACEI/ARB use and a positive COVID-19 test result.\n\n The association between medication use and COVID-19 outcome severity was examined using multinomial logistic regression comparing participants who were not hospitalized to participants who were hospitalized, were admitted to the ICU, used a mechanical ventilator, or died.\n\n All models were adjusted for relevant covariates, including demographics (age, sex, race, ethnicity), selected comorbidities, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI).\n\n\nResults\nThe use of ACEI significantly decreased the odds of a positive COVID-19 test among Veterans with hypertension (OR = 0.917, (0.887, 0.948) and OR = 0.926, (0.894, 0.958) with PSW).\n\n The use of ACEI, but not of ARB, was also associated with significantly increased odds of using mechanical ventilators (OR = 1.265, (1.010, 1.584) and OR = 1.210, (1.053, 1.39) with PSW) among all COVID-19 inpatients compared to outpatients.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this study of Veterans with hypertension, ACEI was significantly associated with decreased odds of testing positive for COVID-19.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle

angiotensin?converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), which are commonly used in patients with hypertension or diabetes and may raise tissue ACE2 levels, could increase the risk of severe COVID?19 infection.\n\n\nMethods and results\nWe evaluated this hypothesis in a consecutive cohort of 1200 acute inpatients with COVID?19 at two hospitals with a multi?ethnic catchment population in London (UK).\n\n The mean age was 68?±?17?years (57% male) and 74% of patients had at least one comorbidity.\n\n Overall, 415 patients (34.6%) reached the primary endpoint of death or transfer to a critical care unit for organ support within 21?days of symptom onset.\n\n A total of 399 patients (33.3%) were taking ACEi or ARB.\n\n Patients on ACEi/ARB were significantly older and had more comorbidities.\n\n The odds ratio for the primary endpoint in patients on ACEi and ARB, after adjustment for age, sex and co?morbidities, was 0.63 (95% confidence interval 0.47–0.84, P?&lt;?0.01).\n\n\nConclusions\nThere was no evidence for increased severity of COVID?19 in hospitalised patients on chronic treatment with ACEi or ARB.\n\n A trend towards a beneficial effect of ACEi/ARB requires further evaluation in larger meta?analyses and randomised clinical trials.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7301045","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Daniel M.","surname":"Bean","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"

mechanisms and applications","abstract":"Viral and bacterial infections are involved in the development of human cancers, such as liver, nasopharyngeal, cervical, head and neck, and gastric cancers.\n Aberrant DNA methylation is frequently present in these cancers, and some of the aberrantly methylated genes are causally involved in cancer development and progression.\n Notably, aberrant DNA methylation can be present even in non-cancerous or precancerous tissues, and its levels correlate with the risk of cancer development, producing a so-called ‘epigenetic field for cancerization’.\n Mechanistically, most viral or bacterial infections induce DNA methylation indirectly via chronic inflammation, but recent studies have indicated that some viruses have direct effects on the epigenetic machinery of host cells.\n From a translational viewpoint, a recent multicenter prospective cohort study demonstrated that assessment of the extent of alterations in DNA methylation in non-cancerous tissues can be used to predict cancer risk.\n Furthermore, suppression of aberrant DNA methylation was shown to be a useful strategy for cancer prevention in an animal model.\n Here, we review the involvement of aberrant DNA methylation in various types of infection-associated cancers, along with individual induction mechanisms, and we discuss the application of these findings for cancer prevention, diagnosis, and therapy.\n","id":"PMC4731931","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Naoko","surname":"Hattori","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Toshikazu","surname":"Ushijima","email":"tushijim@ncc.go.jp","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2559.2011.04033.x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Prostate

(COVID-19) pandemic.\n Strikingly, men account for the majority of COVID-19 deaths, with current figures ranging from 59% to 75% of total mortality.\n However, despite clear implications in relation to COVID-19 mortality, most research has not considered sex as a critical factor in data analysis.\n Here, we highlight fundamental biological differences that exist between males and females, and how these may make significant contributions to the male-biased COVID-19 mortality.\n We present preclinical evidence identifying the influence of biological sex on the expression and regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the main receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells.\n However, we note that there is a lack of reports showing that sexual dimorphism of ACE2 expression exists and is of functional relevance in humans.\n In contrast, there is strong evidence, especially in the context of viral infections, that sexual dimorphism plays a central role in the genetic and hormonal regulation of immune responses, both of the innate and the adaptive immune system.\n We review evidence supporting that ineffective anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses, coupled with a predisposition for inappropriate hyperinflammatory responses, could provide a biological explanation for the male bias in COVID-19 mortality.\n A prominent finding in COVID-19 is the increased risk of death with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension, obesity, and age.\n We contextualize how important features of sexual dimorphism and inflammation in COVID-19 may exhibit a reciprocal relationship with comorbidities, and explain their increased mortality risk.\n Ultimately, we demonstrate that biological sex is a fundamental variable of critical relevance to our mechanistic understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the pursuit of effective COVID-19 preventative and therapeutic strategies.\n","id":"PMC7665363","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Laura

manifestations, including death.\n\n Several studies and meta-analyses have evaluated the role of hypertension on prognosis, but with important limitations and conflicting results.\n\n Therefore, we decided to perform a new meta-analysis of the observational studies that explored the relationship between pre-existing hypertension and mortality risk in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, using more stringent inclusion criteria to overcome the limitations inherent previous meta-analyses.\n\n\nMethods\nA systematic search of the on-line databases available up to 31 March 2022 was conducted, including peer-reviewed original articles, involving the adult population, where the role of hypertension on mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by Cox-proportional hazard models.\n\n Pooled hazard ratio (HR) was calculated by a random effect model.\n\n Sensitivity, heterogeneity, publication bias, subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-six studies (222,083 participants) met the pre-defined inclusion criteria.\n\n In the pooled analysis, pre-existing hypertension was significantly associated with mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, both in unadjusted and adjusted models (HR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.97).\n\n However, in separate analyses including results adjusted for crucial and strong predictors of mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.\n\ng.\n\n body weight), the association disappeared.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe results of this meta-analysis indicate that pre-existing hypertension is not an independent predictor of mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Further studies should nevertheless be carried out worldwide to evaluate this role, independent of, or in interaction with, other confounders that may affect the mortality risk.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9671636","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lanfranco","surname":"D'Elia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alfonso","surname":"Giaquinto","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Aquilino

(ACE2) is a type I integral membrane that exists in two forms: the first is a transmembrane protein; the second is a soluble catalytic ectodomain of ACE2. The catalytic ectodomain of ACE2 undergoes shedding by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17), in which calmodulin mediates the calcium signaling pathway that is involved in ACE2 release, resulting in a soluble catalytic ectodomain of ACE2 that can be measured as soluble ACE2 plasma activity.\n The shedding of the ACE2 catalytic ectodomain plays a role in cardiac remodeling and endothelial dysfunction and is a predictor of all-cause mortality, including cardiovascular mortality.\n Moreover, considerable evidence supports that the ACE2 catalytic ectodomain is an essential entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\n Additionally, endotoxins and the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1? and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF?) all enhanced soluble catalytic ectodomain ACE2 shedding from the airway epithelia, suggesting that the shedding of ACE2 may represent a mechanism by which viral entry and infection may be controlled such as some types of betacoronavirus.\n In this regard, ACE2 plays an important role in inflammation and thrombotic response, and its down-regulation may aggravate COVID-19 via the renin-angiotensin system, including by promoting pathological changes in lung injury.\n Soluble forms of ACE2 have recently been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n Furthermore, given that vitamin D enhanced the shedding of ACE2, some studies reported that vitamin D treatment is associated with prognosis improvement in COVID-19.

The loss of ACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing.\n The ACE2 system is a critical protective pathway against heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction including, myocardial infarction and hypertension, and against lung disease and diabetes mellitus.\n The control of gut dysbiosis and vascular permeability by ACE2 has emerged as an essential mechanism of pulmonary hypertension and diabetic cardiovascular complications.\n Recombinant ACE2, gene-delivery of Ace2, Ang 1–7 analogs, and Mas receptor agonists enhance ACE2 action and serve as potential therapies for disease conditions associated with an activated renin-angiotensin system.\n rhACE2 (recombinant human ACE2) has completed clinical trials and efficiently lowered or increased plasma angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 levels, respectively.\n Our review summarizes the progress over the past 20 years, highlighting the critical role of ACE2 as the novel SARS-CoV-2 receptor and as the negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, together with implications for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and associated cardiovascular diseases.\n","id":"PMC7188049","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mahmoud","surname":"Gheblawi","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Kaiming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anissa","surname":"Viveiros","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Quynh","surname":"Nguyen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiu-Chang","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anthony J.","surname":"Turner","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Mohan K.","surname":"Raizada","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maria B.","surname":"Grant","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gavin Y.","surname":"Oudit","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"}]},{"doi":"10.1161/strokeaha.120.032070","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Effects of Life Events and Social Isolation on Stroke and Coronary Heart Disease","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1136/heartjnl-2019-316250","date":"2020-02-17","title":"Association of social relationships with incident cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality","abstract":"Objective\nTo examine how different aspects of social relationships are associated with incident cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality.\n\n\nMethods\nIn 4139 participants from the population-based Heinz Nixdorf Recall study without previous cardiovascular disease (mean (SD) age 59.1 (7.7) years, 46.7% men), the association of self-reported instrumental, emotional and financial support and social integration at baseline with incident fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality during 13.4-year follow-up was assessed in five different multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models: minimally adjusted model (adjusting for age, sex, social integration or social support, respectively);

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains a global health burden.\n Obesity, a metabolic syndrome affecting one-third of the population, has proven to be a major risk factor for COVID-19 severe complications.\n Several studies have identified metabolic signatures and disrupted metabolic pathways associated with COVID-19, however there are no reports evaluating the role of obesity in the COVID-19 metabolic regulation.\n In this study we highlight the involvement of obesity metabolically in affecting SARS-CoV-2 infection and the consequent health complications, mainly cardiovascular disease.\n We measured one hundred and forty-four (144) metabolites using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) to identify metabolic changes in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, in lean and obese COVID-19 positive (n=82) and COVID-19 negative (n=24) patients.\n The identified metabolites are found to be mainly correlating with glucose, energy and steroid metabolisms.\n Further data analysis indicated twelve (12) significantly yet differentially abundant metabolites associated with viral infection and health complications, in COVID-19 obese patients.\n Two of the detected metabolites, n6-acetyl-l-lysine and p-cresol, are detected only among the COVID-19 cohort, exhibiting significantly higher levels in COVID-19 obese patients when compared to COVID-19 lean patients.\n These metabolites have important roles in viral entry and could explain the increased susceptibility of obese patients.\n On the same note, a set of six metabolites associated with antiviral and anti-inflammatory functions displayed significantly lower abundance in COVID-19 obese patients.\n In conclusion, this report highlights the plasma metabolome of COVID-19 obese patients as a metabolic feature and signature to help improve clinical outcomes.\n We propose n6-acetyl-l-lysine and p-cresol as potential metabolic markers which warrant further investigations to better understand their involvement in different metabolic pathways in

coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection is one of the key determinants of COVID-19 severity and mortality.\n SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells is initiated by binding with its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, and the ACE2 abundance is thought to reflect the susceptibility to infection.\n Here, we report that ibudilast, which we previously identified as a potent inhibitor of protein complex between transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) 3 and NADPH oxidase (Nox) 2, attenuates the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein pseudovirus-evoked contractile and metabolic dysfunctions of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs).\n Epidemiologically reported risk factors of severe COVID-19, including cigarette sidestream smoke (CSS) and anti-cancer drug treatment, commonly upregulate ACE2 expression level, and these were suppressed by inhibiting TRPC3-Nox2 complex formation.\n Exposure of NRCMs to SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, as well as CSS and doxorubicin (Dox), induces ATP release through pannexin-1 hemi-channels, and this ATP release potentiates pseudovirus entry to NRCMs and human iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs).\n As the pseudovirus entry followed by production of reactive oxygen species was attenuated by inhibiting TRPC3-Nox2 complex in hiPS-CMs, we suggest that TRPC3-Nox2 complex formation triggered by panexin1-mediated ATP release participates in exacerbation of myocardial

plateaued and declined.\n\n Obvious downward trends were observed from 29.6 to 2.7% for all-cause mortality (aOR, 0.12; 95%CI, 0.07-0.21; P-value &lt;0.001, P for trend &lt;0.001) and 4.8 to 0.8% for cardio-cerebrovascular mortality (aOR, 0.17; 95%CI, 0.05-0.61; P-value =0.007, P for trend &lt;0.001).\n\n All-cause mortality decreased yearly, whereas cardio-cerebrovascular death increased briefly before declining and stabilizing.\n\n Similarly, the temporal mortality trends in MetS patients of different ages and genders had the same results.\n\n Specifically, the incidence of MetS was higher in women than in men (adjusted P =0.003; OR, 1.14; 95%CI, 1.05-1.24), but the mortality was significantly lower after an average of 7.7 years of follow-up (all-cause mortality, adjusted P &lt;0.001; hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95%CI, 0.57-0.81; cardio-cerebrovascular mortality, adjusted P =0.004; HR, 0.55; 95%CI, 0.37-0.83).\n\n\nConclusion\nFrom 1999 to 2014, the incidence of MetS in U.\n\nS.\n\n adults significantly increased overall, while the mortality rate of MetS had a considerable downward trend.\n\n Both trends showed marked gender differences, being more prevalent and at lower risk in women compared with men.\n\n It is important to identify the factors that will curb the incidence of MetS and decrease mortality, especially in male

(LDL) receptors with a role in cholesterol metabolism and cardiovascular disease.\n It has since emerged as a major risk factor (causative gene) for Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.\n Detailed understanding of the structural features of the three isoforms (apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4), which differ by only a single amino acid interchange, has elucidated their unique functions.\n ApoE2 and apoE4 increase the risk for heart disease: apoE2 increases atherogenic lipoprotein levels (it binds poorly to LDL receptors), and apoE4 increases LDL levels (it binds preferentially to triglyceride-rich, very low density lipoproteins, leading to downregulation of LDL receptors).\n ApoE4 also increases the risk for neurodegenerative diseases, decreases their age of onset, or alters their progression.\n ApoE4 likely causes neurodegeneration secondary to its abnormal structure, caused by an interaction between its carboxyl- and amino-terminal domains, called domain interaction.\n When neurons are stressed or injured, they synthesize apoE to redistribute cholesterol for neuronal repair or remodeling.\n However, because of its altered structure, neuronal apoE4 undergoes neuron-specific proteolysis, generating neurotoxic fragments (12–29 kDa) that escape the secretory pathway and cause mitochondrial dysfunction and cytoskeletal alterations, including tau phosphorylation.\n ApoE4-associated pathology can be prevented by small-molecule structure correctors that block domain interaction by converting apoE4 to a molecule that resembles apoE3 both structurally and functionally.\n Structure correctors are a potential therapeutic approach to reduce apoE4 pathology in both cardiovascular and neurological disorders.\n","id":"PMC4921111","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Robert

Role of Platelet-Endothelium Interactions in the Pathogenesis of Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection-Associated Myocardial Injury","abstract":"Cardiovascular dysfunction and disease are common and frequently fatal complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\n Indeed, from early on during the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic it was recognized that cardiac complications may occur, even in patients with no underlying cardiac disorders, as part of the acute infection, and that these were associated with more severe disease and increased morbidity and mortality.\n The most common cardiac complication is acute cardiac injury, defined by significant elevation of cardiac troponins.\n The potential mechanisms of cardiovascular complications include direct viral myocardial injury, systemic inflammation induced by the virus, sepsis, arrhythmia, myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch, electrolyte abnormalities, and hypercoagulability.\n This review is focused on the prevalence, risk factors and clinical course of COVID-19-related myocardial injury, as well as on current data with regard to disease pathogenesis, specifically the interaction of platelets with the vascular endothelium.\n The latter section includes consideration of the role of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in triggering development of a generalized endotheliitis that, in turn, drives intense activation of platelets.\n Most prominently, SARS-CoV-2–induced endotheliitis involves interaction of the viral spike protein with endothelial angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) together with alternative mechanisms that involve the nucleocapsid and viroporin.\n In addition, the mechanisms by which activated platelets intensify endothelial activation and dysfunction, seemingly driven by release of the platelet-derived calcium-binding proteins, SA100A8 and SA100A9, are described.\n These events create a SARS-CoV-2–driven cycle of intravascular inflammation and coagulation, which contributes significantly to a poor clinical outcome in patients with severe disease.\n","id":"PMC8854752","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Theresa

characterized by abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.\n Though there is some variation in the definition by other health care organization, the differences are minor.\n With the successful conquest of communicable infectious diseases in most of the world, this new non-communicable disease (NCD) has become the major health hazard of modern world.\n Though it started in the Western world, with the spread of the Western lifestyle across the globe, it has become now a truly global problem.\n The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is often more in the urban population of some developing countries than in its Western counterparts.\n The two basic forces spreading this malady are the increase in consumption of high calorie-low fiber fast food and the decrease in physical activity due to mechanized transportations and sedentary form of leisure time activities.\n The syndrome feeds into the spread of the diseases like type 2 diabetes, coronary diseases, stroke, and other disabilities.\n The total cost of the malady including the cost of health care and loss of potential economic activity is in trillions.\n The present trend is not sustainable unless a magic cure is found (unlikely) or concerted global/governmental/societal efforts are made to change the lifestyle that is promoting it.\n There are certainly some elements in the causation of the metabolic syndrome that cannot be changed but many are amenable for corrections and curtailments.\n For example, better urban planning to encourage active lifestyle, subsidizing consumption of whole grains and possible taxing high calorie snacks, restricting media advertisement of unhealthy food, etc.\n Revitalizing old fashion healthier lifestyle, promoting old-fashioned foods using healthy herbs rather than oil and sugar, and educating people about choosing healthy/wholesome food over junks are among the steps that can be

lungs from a human ACE2 transgenic mouse infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the control infected with mock; human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived liver organoids infected with SARS-CoV-2; adipose tissues from a mouse model of COVID-19 overexpressing human ACE2 via adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) compared to the control GFP after SARS-CoV-2 infection;

ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous and widely expressed in the heart, vessels, gut, lung (particularly in type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages), kidney, testis and brain.\n ACE2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form.\n An important salutary function of membrane-bound and soluble ACE2 is the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin1-7.\n Consequently, ACE2 receptors limit several detrimental effects resulting from binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptors, which include vasoconstriction, enhanced inflammation and thrombosis.\n The increased generation of angiotensin1-7 also triggers counter-regulatory protective effects through binding to G-protein coupled Mas receptors.\n Unfortunately, the entry of SARS-CoV2 into the cells through membrane fusion markedly down-regulates ACE2 receptors, with loss of the catalytic effect of these receptors at the external site of the membrane.\n Increased pulmonary inflammation and coagulation have been reported as unwanted effects of enhanced and unopposed angiotensin II effects via the ACE?Angiotensin II?AT1 receptor axis.\n Clinical reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show that several features associated with infection and severity of the disease (i.\ne.\n, older age, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) share a variable degree of ACE2 deficiency.\n We suggest that ACE2 down-regulation induced by viral invasion may be especially detrimental in people with baseline ACE2 deficiency associated with the above conditions.\n The additional ACE2 deficiency after viral invasion might amplify the dysregulation between the ‘adverse’ ACE?Angiotensin II?AT1 receptor axis and the ‘protective’ ACE2?Angiotensin1-7?Mas receptor axis.\n In the lungs, such dysregulation would favor the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes triggered by local angiotensin II hyperactivity unopposed by angiotensin1-7.\n In this setting, recombinant ACE2, angiotensin1-7 and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers could be promising therapeutic approaches in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n","id":"PMC7167588","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Paolo","surname":"Verdecchia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Claudio","surname":"Cavallini","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Antonio","surname":"Spanevello","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fabio","surname":"Angeli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.11.003","date":"2021-11-07","title":"Sex- and age-specific regulation of ACE2: Insights into severe COVID-19 susceptibility","abstract":"Aged males disproportionately succumb to increased COVID-19 severity, hospitalization, and mortality compared to females.\n Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) facilitate SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and may have sexually dimorphic regulation.\n As viral load dictates disease severity, we investigated the expression, protein levels, and activity of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.

By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity.\n In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality.\n Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients.\n Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.\n Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7187729","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xinhui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotian","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients’ clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAmong both case patients and controls, the mean (±SD) age was 68±13 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other

We aimed to evaluate whether continuing versus discontinuing renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) affects outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nMethods\nThe REPLACE COVID trial was a prospective, randomised, open-label trial done at 20 large referral hospitals in seven countries worldwide.\n\n Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor before admission.\n\n Individuals with contraindications to continuation or discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their renin–angiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system.\n\n The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan dysfunction during the hospitalisation.\n\n Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n The REPLACE COVID trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04338009.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween March 31 and Aug 20, 2020, 152 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either continue or discontinue renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy (continuation group n=75; discontinuation group n=77).\n\n Mean age of participants was 62 years (SD 12), 68 (45%) were female, mean body-mass index was 33 kg/m2 (SD 8), and 79 (52%) had diabetes.\n\n Compared with discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, continuation had no effect on the global rank score (median rank 73 [IQR 40–110] for continuation vs 81 [38–117] for discontinuation; ?-coefficient 8 [95% CI ?13 to 29]).\n\n There were 16 (21%) of 75 participants in the continuation arm versus 14 (18%) of 77 in the discontinuation arm who required intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation, and 11 (15%) of 75 participants in the continuation group versus ten (13%) of 77 in the discontinuation group died.\n\n 29 (39%) participants in the continuation group and 28 (36%) participants in the discontinuation group had at least one adverse event (?2 test of adverse events between treatment groups p=0·77).\n\n There was no difference in blood pressure, serum potassium, or creatinine during follow-up across the two groups.\n\n\nInterpretation\nConsistent with international society recommendations, renin–angiotensin system inhibitors can be safely continued in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nFunding\nREPLACE COVID Investigators, REPLACE COVID Trial Social Fundraising Campaign, and

enzyme 2, which can be upregulated by inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS).\n\n We aimed to test our hypothesis that discontinuation of chronic treatment with ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) mitigates the course o\f recent-onset COVID-19.\nMethods\nACEI-COVID was a parallel group, randomised, controlled, open-label trial done at 35 centres in Austria and Germany.\n\n Patients aged 18 years and older were enrolled if they presented with recent symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and were chronically treated with ACEIs or ARBs.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to discontinuation or continuation of RAS inhibition for 30 days.\n\n Primary outcome was the maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score within 30 days, where death was scored with the maximum achievable SOFA score.\n\n Secondary endpoints were area under the death-adjusted SOFA score (AUCSOFA), mean SOFA score, admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, and death.\n\n Analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis.\n\n This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04353596.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween April 20, 2020, and Jan 20, 2021, 204 patients (median age 75 years [IQR 66–80], 37% females) were randomly assigned to discontinue (n=104) or continue (n=100) RAS inhibition.\n\n Within 30 days, eight (8%) of 104 died in the discontinuation group and 12 (12%) of 100 patients died in the continuation group (p=0·42).\n\n There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between the discontinuation and continuation group (median [IQR] maximum SOFA score 0·00 (0·00–2·00) vs 1·00 (0·00–3·00); p=0·12).\n\n Discontinuation was associated with a significantly lower AUCSOFA (0·00 [0·00–9·25] vs 3·50 [0·00–23·50]; p=0·040), mean SOFA score (0·00 [0·00–0·31] vs 0·12 [0·00–0·78]; p=0·040), and 30-day SOFA score (0·00 [10–90th percentile, 0·00–1·20] vs 0·00 [0·00–24·00]; p=0·023).\n\n At 30 days, 11 (11%) in the discontinuation group and 23 (23%) in the continuation group had signs of organ dysfunction (SOFA score ?1) or were dead (p=0·017).\n\n There were no significant differences for mechanical ventilation (10 (10%) vs 8 (8%), p=0·87) and admission to intensive care unit (20 [19%] vs 18 [18%], p=0·96) between the discontinuation and continuation group.\n\n\nInterpretation\nDiscontinuation of RAS-inhibition in COVID-19 had no significant effect on the maximum severity of COVID-19 but may lead to a faster and better recovery.\n\n The decision

Using data from 228,722 Veterans with a history of hypertension who received COVID-19 testing at the VA, we investigated whether the use of ACEI or ARB over the two years prior to the index date was associated with increased odds of (1) a positive COVID-19 test, and (2) a severe outcome (hospitalization, mortality, and use of intensive care unit (ICU) and/or mechanical ventilation) among COVID-19-positive patients.\n\n We used logistic regression with and without propensity score weighting (PSW) to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the association between ACEI/ARB use and a positive COVID-19 test result.\n\n The association between medication use and COVID-19 outcome severity was examined using multinomial logistic regression comparing participants who were not hospitalized to participants who were hospitalized, were admitted to the ICU, used a mechanical ventilator, or died.\n\n All models were adjusted for relevant covariates, including demographics (age, sex, race, ethnicity), selected comorbidities, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI).\n\n\nResults\nThe use of ACEI significantly decreased the odds of a positive COVID-19 test among Veterans with hypertension (OR = 0.917, (0.887, 0.948) and OR = 0.926, (0.894, 0.958) with PSW).\n\n The use of ACEI, but not of ARB, was also associated with significantly increased odds of using mechanical ventilators (OR = 1.265, (1.010, 1.584) and OR = 1.210, (1.053, 1.39) with PSW) among all COVID-19 inpatients compared to outpatients.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this study of Veterans with hypertension, ACEI was significantly associated with decreased odds of testing positive for COVID-19.

throughout China.\n\n This study aimed to clarify the characteristics of patients with refractory COVID-19.\nMethods\nIn this retrospective single-center study, we included 155 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1st to February 5th.\n\n The cases were divided into general and refractory COVID-19 groups according to the clinical efficacy after hospitalization, and the difference between groups were compared.\n\n\nResults\nCompared with general COVID-19 patients (45.2%), refractory patients had an older age, male sex, more underlying comorbidities, lower incidence of fever, higher levels of maximum temperature among fever cases, higher incidence of breath shortness and anorexia, severer disease assessment on admission, high levels of neutrophil, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein, lower levels of platelets and albumin, and higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion (P&lt;0.05).\n\n Refractory COVID-19 patients were more likely to receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, and adjunctive treatment including corticosteroid, antiviral drugs and immune enhancer (P&lt;0.05).\n\n After adjustment, those with refractory COVID-19 were also more likely to have a male sex and manifestations of anorexia and fever on admission, and receive oxygen, expectorant and adjunctive agents (P&lt;0.05) when considering the factors of disease severity on admission, mechanical ventilation, and ICU transfer.\n\n\nConclusion\nNearly 50% COVID-19 patients could not reach obvious clinical and radiological remission within 10 days after hospitalization.\n\n The patients with male sex, anorexia and no fever on admission predicted poor efficacy.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184444","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Pingzheng","surname":"Mo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuanyuan","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Liping","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qiu","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hongling","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhenshun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shicheng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ke","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mingqi","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tielong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shihui","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhiyong","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaoping","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ruiying","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qian","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wang","email":"fanndywang@foxmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongxi","surname":"Zhang","email":"znact1936@126.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Characteristics

Initial immune and inflammatory responses induce a severe cytokine storm [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-7, IL-22, IL-17, etc.\n] during the rapid progression phase of COVID-19. Early evaluation and continued monitoring of cardiac damage (cTnI and NT-proBNP) and coagulation (D-dimer) after hospitalization may identify patients with cardiac injury and predict COVID-19 complications.\n Preventive measures (social distancing and social isolation) also increase cardiovascular risk.\n Cardiovascular considerations of therapies currently used, including remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, ribavirin, interferons, and lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as experimental therapies, such as human recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2), are discussed.\n","id":"PMC7197627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tomasz

A first step in understanding SARS pathogenesis","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute infectious disease that spreads mainly via the respiratory route.\n A distinct coronavirus (SARS?CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS.\n Recently, a metallopeptidase named angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS?CoV.\n Although ACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression is largely unknown.\n Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the present study investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs (oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain).\n The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.\n Furthermore, ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied.\n In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the SARS?CoV.\n This epithelial expression, together with the presence of ACE2 in vascular endothelium, also provides a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations.\n Copyright © 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.\n Published by John Wiley &amp;

and we consider the possibility of inferring information despite de-identification.\n\n\nResults\nTrue PIs were masked with 98.8% precision and 97.6% recall.\n\n As anticipated, potential PIs did appear, owing to misspellings entered within the EHRs.\n\n We found one potential breach.\n\n In a separate performance test, with a different set of notes, CRIS yielded 100% precision and 88.5% recall, while MIST yielded a 95.1% and 78.1%, respectively.\n\n We discuss how we overcome the realistic possibility – albeit of low probability – of potential breaches through implementation of the security model.\n\n\nConclusion\nCRIS is a de-identified psychiatric database sourced from EHRs, which protects patient anonymity and maximises data available for research.\n\n CRIS demonstrates the advantage of combining an effective de-identification algorithm with a carefully designed security model.\n\n The paper advances much needed discussion of EHR de-identification – particularly in relation to criteria to assess de-identification, and considering the contexts of de-identified research databases when assessing the risk of breaches of confidential patient information.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3751474","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Andrea C","surname":"Fernandes","email":"andrea.1.fernandes@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Danielle","surname":"Cloete","email":"dcloete@hotmail.co.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Matthew TM","surname":"Broadbent","email":"matthew.broadbent@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Richard D","surname":"Hayes","email":"Richard.hayes@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chin-Kuo","surname":"Chang","email":"chin-kuo.chang@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard G","surname":"Jackson","email":"richard.g.jackson@slam.nhs.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Angus","surname":"Roberts","email":"a.roberts@sheffield.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jason","surname":"Tsang","email":"jason.tsang@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Murat","surname":"Soncul","email":"murat.soncul@slam.nhs.uk","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jennifer","surname":"Liebscher","email":"Jennifer.liebscher@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Stewart","email":"Robert.stewart@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Felicity","surname":"Callard","email":"felicity.callard@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000183","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Automated concept-level information extraction to reduce the need for custom software and rules development","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"An Overview of the Tesseract OCR Engine","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0112774","date":"2014-10-18","title":"Negation’s Not Solved: Generalizability Versus Optimizability in Clinical Natural Language Processing","abstract":"A review of published work in clinical natural language processing (NLP) may suggest that the negation detection task has been “solved.\n” This work proposes that an optimizable solution does not equal a generalizable solution.\n We introduce a new machine learning-based Polarity Module for detecting negation in clinical text, and extensively compare its performance across domains.\n Using four manually annotated corpora of clinical text, we show that negation detection performance suffers when there is no in-domain development (for manual methods) or training data (for machine learning-based methods).\n Various factors (e.\ng.\n, annotation guidelines, named entity characteristics, the amount of data, and lexical and syntactic context) play a role in making generalizability difficult, but none completely explains the phenomenon.\n Furthermore, generalizability remains challenging because it is unclear whether to use a single source for accurate data, combine all sources into a single model, or apply domain adaptation methods.\n The most reliable means to improve negation detection is to manually annotate in-domain training data (or, perhaps, manually modify rules);

sequencing, imaging, sensor, societal and publicly available data present a rapidly expanding digital trace of health.\n\n We aimed to critically review, for the first time, the challenges and potential of big data across early and late stages of translational cardiovascular disease research.\n\n\nMethods and results\nWe sought exemplars based on literature reviews and expertise across the BigData@Heart Consortium.\n\n We identified formidable challenges including: data quality, knowing what data exist, the legal and ethical framework for their use, data sharing, building and maintaining public trust, developing standards for defining disease, developing tools for scalable, replicable science and equipping the clinical and scientific work force with new inter-disciplinary skills.\n\n Opportunities claimed for big health record data include: richer profiles of health and disease from birth to death and from the molecular to the societal scale; accelerated understanding of disease causation and progression, discovery of new mechanisms and treatment-relevant disease sub-phenotypes, understanding health and diseases in whole populations and whole health systems and returning actionable feedback loops to improve (and potentially disrupt) existing models of research and care, with greater efficiency.\n\n In early translational research we identified exemplars including: discovery of fundamental biological processes e.\n\ng.\n\n linking exome sequences to lifelong electronic health records (EHR) (e.\n\ng.\n\n human knockout experiments); drug development: genomic approaches to drug target validation; precision medicine: e.\n\ng.\n\n DNA integrated into hospital EHR for pre-emptive pharmacogenomics.\n\n In late translational research we identified

population-based linkages of multiple EHR sources for higher resolution clinical epidemiology and public health.\n\n\nConclusion\nHigh volumes of inherently diverse (‘big’) EHR data are beginning to

collection at the point of care.\n\n However, as the significance of the modern information economy expands in scope and permeates the healthcare domain, there is an increasing urgency for healthcare organisations to offer information systems that address the expectations of clinicians, researchers and the business intelligence community alike.\n\n Amongst other emergent requirements, the principal unmet need might be defined as the 3R principle (right data, right place, right time) to address deficiencies in organisational data flow while retaining the strict information governance policies that apply within the UK National Health Service (NHS).\n\n Here, we describe our work on creating and deploying a low cost structured and unstructured information retrieval and extraction architecture within King’s College Hospital, the management of governance concerns and the associated use cases and cost saving opportunities that such components present.\n\n\nResults\nTo date, our CogStack architecture has processed over 300 million lines of clinical data, making it available for internal service improvement projects at King’s College London.\n\n On generated data designed to simulate real world clinical text, our de-identification algorithm achieved up to 94% precision and up to 96% recall.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe describe a toolkit which we feel is of huge value to the UK (and beyond) healthcare community.\n\n It is the only open source, easily deployable solution designed for the UK healthcare environment, in a landscape populated by expensive proprietary systems.\n\n

informaticians and electronic health record systems around the world.\n Its detailed descriptions of clinical abnormalities and computable disease definitions have made HPO the de facto standard for deep phenotyping in the field of rare disease.\n The HPO’s interoperability with other ontologies has enabled it to be used to improve diagnostic accuracy by incorporating model organism data.\n It also plays a key role in the popular Exomiser tool, which identifies potential disease-causing variants from whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing data.\n Since the HPO was first introduced in 2008, its users have become both more numerous and more diverse.\n To meet these emerging needs, the project has added new content, language translations, mappings and computational tooling, as well as integrations with external community data.\n The HPO continues to collaborate with clinical adopters to improve specific areas of the ontology and extend standardized disease descriptions.\n The newly redesigned HPO website (www.\nhuman-phenotype-ontology.\norg) simplifies browsing terms and exploring clinical features, diseases, and human

Risk Score focusing on older people in acute care settings using electronic hospital records: an observational study","abstract":"Background\nOlder people are increasing users of health care globally.\n\n We aimed to establish whether older people with characteristics of frailty and who are at risk of adverse health-care outcomes could be identified using routinely collected data.\n\n\nMethods\nA three-step approach was used to develop and validate a Hospital Frailty Risk Score from International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnostic codes.\n\n First, we carried out a cluster analysis to identify a group of older people (?75 years) admitted to hospital who had high resource use and diagnoses associated with frailty.\n\n Second, we created a Hospital Frailty Risk Score based on ICD-10 codes that characterised this group.\n\n Third, in separate cohorts, we tested how well the score predicted adverse outcomes and whether it identified similar groups as other frailty tools.\n\n\nFindings\nIn the development cohort (n=22?139), older people with frailty diagnoses formed a distinct group and had higher non-elective hospital use (33·6 bed-days over 2 years compared with 23·0 bed-days for the group with the next highest number of bed-days).\n\n In the national validation cohort (n=1?013?590), compared with the 429?762 (42·4%) patients with the lowest risk scores, the 202?718 (20·0%) patients with the highest Hospital Frailty Risk Scores had increased odds of 30-day mortality (odds ratio 1·71, 95% CI 1·68–1·75), long hospital stay (6·03, 5·92–6·10), and 30-day readmission (1·48, 1·46–1·50).\n\n The c statistics (ie, model discrimination) between individuals for these three outcomes were 0·60, 0·68, and 0·56, respectively.\n\n The Hospital Frailty Risk Score showed fair overlap with dichotomised Fried and Rockwood scales (kappa scores 0·22, 95% CI 0·15–0·30 and 0·30, 0·22–0·38, respectively) and moderate agreement with the Rockwood Frailty Index (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0·41, 95% CI 0·38–0·47).\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe Hospital Frailty Risk Score provides hospitals and health systems with a low-cost, systematic way to screen for frailty and identify a group of patients who are at greater risk of adverse outcomes and for whom a frailty-attuned approach might be useful.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Institute for Health

United States Community Practice: Findings From the ORBIT?AF Registry","abstract":"Background\nThe prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) continues to increase; however, there are limited data describing the division of care among practitioners in the community and whether care differs depending on provider specialty.\n\n\nMethods and Results\nUsing the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of AF (ORBIT?AF) Registry, we described patient characteristics and AF management strategies in ambulatory clinic practice settings, including electrophysiology (EP), general cardiology, and primary care.\n\n A total of 10 097 patients were included; of these, 1544 (15.3%) were cared for by an EP provider, 6584 (65.2%) by a cardiology provider, and 1969 (19.5%) by an internal medicine/primary care provider.\n\n Compared with those patients who were cared for by cardiologists or internal medicine/primary care providers, patients cared for by EP providers were younger (median age, 73 years [interquartile range, IQR, 64, 80 years, Q1, Q3] versus 75 years [IQR, 67, 82 years] for cardiology and versus 76 years [IQR, 68, 82 years] for primary care).\n\n Compared with cardiology and internal medicine/primary care providers, EP providers used rhythm control (versus rate control) management more often (44.2% versus 29.7% and 28.8%, respectively, P&lt;0.0001; adjusted odds ratio [OR] EP versus cardiology, 1.66 [95% confidence interval, CI, 1.05 to 2.61]; adjusted OR for internal medicine/primary care versus cardiology, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.65 to 1.26]).\n\n Use of oral anticoagulant therapy was high across all providers, although it was higher for cardiology and EP providers (overall, 76.1%; P=0.02 for difference between groups).\n\n\nConclusions\nOur data demonstrate important differences between provider specialties, the demographics of the AF patient population treated, and treatment strategies—particularly for rhythm control and anticoagulation therapy.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3828776","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Emil L.","surname":"Fosbol","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"DaJuanicia

By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity.\n In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality.\n Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients.\n Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.\n Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7187729","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xinhui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotian","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without

2019 (Covid-19) has not been well studied.\n\n\nMethods\nWe carried out a population-based case–control study in the Lombardy region of Italy.\n\n A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients’ clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAmong both case patients and controls, the mean (±SD) age was 68±13 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile.\n\n Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients

We aimed to evaluate whether continuing versus discontinuing renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) affects outcomes in

Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor before admission.\n\n Individuals with

their renin–angiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system.\n\n The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan

(COVID-19) pandemic.\n Strikingly, men account for the majority of COVID-19 deaths, with current figures ranging from 59% to 75% of total mortality.\n However, despite clear implications in relation to COVID-19 mortality, most research has not considered sex as a critical factor in data analysis.\n Here, we highlight fundamental biological differences that exist between males and females, and how these may make significant contributions to the male-biased COVID-19 mortality.\n We present preclinical evidence identifying the influence of biological sex on the expression and regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the main receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells.\n However, we note that there is a lack of reports showing that sexual dimorphism of ACE2 expression exists and is of functional relevance in humans.\n In contrast, there is strong evidence, especially in the context of viral infections, that sexual dimorphism plays a central role in the genetic and hormonal regulation of immune responses, both of the innate and the adaptive immune system.\n We review evidence supporting that ineffective anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses, coupled with a predisposition for inappropriate hyperinflammatory responses, could provide a biological explanation for the male bias in COVID-19 mortality.\n A prominent finding in COVID-19 is the increased risk of death with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension, obesity, and age.\n We contextualize how important features of sexual dimorphism and inflammation in COVID-19 may exhibit a reciprocal relationship with comorbidities, and explain their increased mortality risk.\n Ultimately, we demonstrate that biological sex is a fundamental variable of critical relevance to our mechanistic understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the pursuit of effective COVID-19 preventative and therapeutic

series.\n\n\nSetting\nTongji Hospital in Wuhan, China.\n\n\nParticipants\nAmong a cohort of 799 patients, 113 who died and 161 who recovered with a diagnosis of covid-19 were analysed.\n\n Data were collected until 28 February 2020.\nMain outcome measures\nClinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years).\n\n Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%).\n\n Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)).\n\n Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62%), 55 (49%), and 25 (22%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%), 48 (30%), and 1 (1%)).\n\n The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days.\n\n Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50%) patients who died and 6 (4%) who recovered, and lymphopenia was present in 103 (91%) and 76 (47%) respectively.\n\n Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients.\n\n Common complications observed more frequently in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 100%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart failure (41/83; 49%), alkalosis (14/35;

manifestations, including death.\n\n Several studies and meta-analyses have evaluated the role of hypertension on prognosis, but with important limitations and conflicting results.\n\n Therefore, we decided to perform a new meta-analysis of the observational studies that explored the relationship between pre-existing hypertension and mortality risk in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, using more stringent inclusion criteria to overcome the limitations inherent previous meta-analyses.\n\n\nMethods\nA systematic search of the on-line databases available up to 31 March 2022 was conducted, including peer-reviewed original articles, involving the adult population, where the role of hypertension on mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by Cox-proportional hazard models.\n\n Pooled hazard ratio (HR) was calculated by a random effect model.\n\n Sensitivity, heterogeneity, publication bias, subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-six studies (222,083 participants) met the pre-defined inclusion criteria.\n\n In the pooled analysis, pre-existing hypertension was significantly associated with mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, both in unadjusted and adjusted models (HR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.97).\n\n However, in separate analyses including results adjusted for crucial and strong predictors of mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.\n\ng.\n\n body weight), the association disappeared.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe results of this meta-analysis indicate that pre-existing hypertension is not an independent predictor of mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Further studies should nevertheless be carried out worldwide to evaluate this role, independent of, or in interaction with, other confounders that may affect the mortality

(ACE2) is a type I integral membrane that exists in two forms: the first is a transmembrane protein; the second is a soluble catalytic ectodomain of ACE2. The catalytic ectodomain of ACE2 undergoes shedding by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17), in which calmodulin mediates the calcium signaling pathway that is involved in ACE2 release, resulting in a soluble catalytic ectodomain of ACE2 that can be measured as soluble ACE2 plasma activity.\n The shedding of the ACE2 catalytic ectodomain plays a role in cardiac remodeling and endothelial dysfunction and is a predictor of all-cause mortality, including cardiovascular mortality.\n Moreover, considerable evidence supports that the ACE2 catalytic ectodomain is an essential entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\n Additionally, endotoxins and the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1? and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF?) all enhanced soluble catalytic ectodomain ACE2 shedding from the airway epithelia, suggesting that the shedding of ACE2 may represent a mechanism by which viral entry and infection may be controlled such as some types of betacoronavirus.\n In this regard, ACE2 plays an important role in inflammation and thrombotic response, and its down-regulation may aggravate COVID-19 via the renin-angiotensin system, including by promoting pathological changes in lung injury.\n Soluble forms of ACE2 have recently been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n Furthermore, given that vitamin D enhanced the shedding of ACE2, some studies reported that vitamin D treatment is associated with prognosis improvement in COVID-19.

trivalent function: a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, facilitator of amino acid transport, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 receptor.\n ACE2 is widely expressed, including, in the lungs, cardiovascular system, gut, kidneys, central nervous system, and adipose tissue.\n ACE2 has recently been identified as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the infective agent responsible for coronavirus disease 2019, providing a critical link between immunity, inflammation, ACE2, and cardiovascular disease.\n Although sharing a close evolutionary relationship with SARS-CoV, the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 differs in several key amino acid residues, allowing for stronger binding affinity with the human ACE2 receptor, which may account for the greater pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The loss of ACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing.\n The ACE2 system is a critical protective pathway against heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction including, myocardial infarction and hypertension, and against lung disease and diabetes mellitus.\n The control of gut dysbiosis and vascular permeability by ACE2 has emerged as an essential mechanism of pulmonary hypertension and diabetic cardiovascular complications.\n Recombinant ACE2, gene-delivery of Ace2, Ang 1–7 analogs, and Mas receptor agonists enhance ACE2 action and serve as potential therapies for disease conditions associated with an activated renin-angiotensin system.\n rhACE2 (recombinant human ACE2) has completed clinical trials and efficiently lowered or increased plasma angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 levels, respectively.\n Our review summarizes the progress over the past 20 years, highlighting the critical role of ACE2 as the novel SARS-CoV-2 receptor and as the negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, together with implications for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and associated cardiovascular diseases.\n","id":"PMC7188049","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mahmoud","surname":"Gheblawi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kaiming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anissa","surname":"Viveiros","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Quynh","surname":"Nguyen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiu-Chang","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anthony J.","surname":"Turner","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mohan K.","surname":"Raizada","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maria B.","surname":"Grant","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gavin Y.","surname":"Oudit","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1161/strokeaha.120.032070","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Effects of Life Events and Social Isolation on Stroke and Coronary Heart Disease","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1136/heartjnl-2019-316250","date":"2020-02-17","title":"Association of social relationships with incident cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality","abstract":"Objective\nTo examine how different aspects of social relationships are associated with incident cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality.\n\n\nMethods\nIn 4139 participants from the population-based Heinz Nixdorf Recall study without previous cardiovascular disease (mean (SD) age 59.1 (7.7) years, 46.7% men), the association of self-reported instrumental, emotional and financial support and social integration at baseline with incident fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality during 13.4-year follow-up was assessed in five different multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models: minimally adjusted model (adjusting for age, sex, social integration or social support, respectively);

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in critically ill patients, nationwide data on the outcome of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and PE are still limited.\n\n Thus, we investigated seasonal trends and predictors of in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19 and PE in Germany.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used a German nationwide inpatient sample to analyse data on hospitalisations among COVID-19 patients with and without PE during 2020, and to detect changes in PE prevalence and case fatality in comparison with 2019.\nResults\nWe analysed 176?137 COVID-19 hospitalisations in 2020; PE was recorded in 1.9% (n=3362) of discharge certificates.\n\n Almost one-third of patients with COVID-19 and PE died during the in-hospital course (28.7%) compared with COVID-19 patients without PE (17.7%).\n\n Between 2019 and 2020, numbers of PE-related hospitalisations were largely unchanged (98?485 versus 97?718), whereas the case fatality rate of PE increased slightly in 2020 (from 12.7% to 13.1%; p&lt;0.001).\n\n Differences in case fatality were found between PE patients with and without COVID-19 in 2020 (28.7% versus 12.5%; p&lt;0.001), corresponding to a 3.1-fold increased risk of PE-related death (OR 3.16, 95% CI 2.91–3.42; p&lt;0.001) in the presence of COVID-19.\nConclusions\nIn Germany, the prevalence of PE events during hospitalisations was similar in 2019 and 2020. However, the fatality rate among patients with both COVID-19 and PE was substantially higher than that in those with only one of these diseases, suggesting a life-threatening additive prognostic impact of the COVID-19–PE combination.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9411730","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lukas","surname":"Hobohm","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ingo","surname":"Sagoschen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ingo","surname":"Sagoschen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stefano","surname":"Barco","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ioannis T.","surname":"Farmakis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ioannis T.","surname":"Farmakis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ugo","surname":"Fedeli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ugo","surname":"Fedeli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sebastian","surname":"Koelmel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommaso","surname":"Gori","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christine","surname":"Espinola-Klein","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Münzel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stavros","surname":"Konstantinides","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Karsten","surname":"Keller","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Karsten","surname":"Keller","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052","date":"2020-02-25","title":"SARS-CoV-2 Cell Entry Depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and Is Blocked by a Clinically Proven Protease Inhibitor","abstract":"The recent emergence of the novel, pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency.\n Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases.\n Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets.\n Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming.\n A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option.\n Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry.\n Our results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention.\n","id":"PMC7102627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Markus","surname":"Hoffmann","email":"mhoffmann@dpz.eu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hannah","surname":"Kleine-Weber","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"Schroeder","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nadine","surname":"Krüger","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tanja","surname":"Herrler","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sandra","surname":"Erichsen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tobias S.","surname":"Schiergens","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Georg","surname":"Herrler","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nai-Huei","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andreas","surname":"Nitsche","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marcel A.","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stefan","surname":"Pöhlmann","email":"spoehlmann@dpz.eu","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/1745691614568352","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Loneliness and social isolation as risk factors for mortality: a meta-analytic review","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.vph.2017.05.005","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species in endothelial dysfunction associated with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2022.101541","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID-19, Heart Failure Hospitalizations, and Outcomes: A Nationwide Analysis","abstract":"Heart Failure (HF) patients are at a higher risk of adverse events associated with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n Large population-based reports of the impact of COVID-19 on patients hospitalized with HF are limited.\n The National Inpatient Sample database was queried for HF admissions during 2020 in the United States (US), with and without a diagnosis of COVID-19 based on ICD-10-CM U07.

complications.\n Several studies have identified metabolic signatures and disrupted metabolic pathways associated with COVID-19, however there are no reports evaluating the role of obesity in the COVID-19 metabolic regulation.\n In this study we highlight the involvement of obesity metabolically in affecting SARS-CoV-2 infection and the consequent health complications, mainly cardiovascular disease.\n We measured one hundred and forty-four (144) metabolites using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) to identify metabolic changes in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, in lean and obese COVID-19 positive (n=82) and COVID-19 negative (n=24) patients.\n The identified metabolites are found to be mainly correlating with glucose, energy and steroid metabolisms.\n Further data analysis indicated twelve (12) significantly yet differentially abundant metabolites associated with viral infection and health complications, in COVID-19 obese patients.\n Two of the detected metabolites, n6-acetyl-l-lysine and p-cresol, are detected only among the COVID-19 cohort, exhibiting significantly higher levels in COVID-19 obese patients when compared to COVID-19 lean patients.\n These metabolites have important roles in viral entry and could explain the increased susceptibility of obese patients.\n On the same note, a set of six metabolites associated with antiviral and anti-inflammatory functions displayed significantly lower abundance in COVID-19 obese patients.\n In conclusion, this report highlights the plasma metabolome of COVID-19 obese patients as a metabolic feature and signature to help improve clinical outcomes.\n We propose n6-acetyl-l-lysine and p-cresol as potential metabolic markers which warrant further investigations to better understand their involvement in different metabolic pathways in

coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection is one of the key determinants of COVID-19 severity and mortality.\n SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells is initiated by binding with its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, and the ACE2 abundance is thought to reflect the susceptibility to infection.\n Here, we report that ibudilast, which we previously identified as a potent inhibitor of protein complex between transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) 3 and NADPH oxidase (Nox) 2, attenuates the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein pseudovirus-evoked contractile and metabolic dysfunctions of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs).\n Epidemiologically reported risk factors of severe COVID-19, including cigarette sidestream smoke (CSS) and anti-cancer drug treatment, commonly upregulate ACE2 expression level, and these were suppressed by inhibiting TRPC3-Nox2 complex formation.\n Exposure of NRCMs to SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, as well as CSS and doxorubicin (Dox), induces ATP release through pannexin-1 hemi-channels, and this ATP release potentiates pseudovirus entry to NRCMs and human iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs).\n As the pseudovirus entry followed by production of reactive oxygen species was attenuated by inhibiting TRPC3-Nox2 complex in hiPS-CMs, we suggest that TRPC3-Nox2 complex formation triggered by panexin1-mediated ATP release participates in exacerbation of myocardial damage by amplifying ACE2-dependent SARS-CoV-2

found in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in many vascular beds.\n Among the best characterized functions of ACE2 is its role in regulating vascular tone.\n ACE2 through its effector peptide Ang-(1-7) and receptor Mas1 induces vasodilation and attenuates Ang II-induced vasoconstriction.\n In endothelial cells activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas1 axis increases production of the vasodilator’s nitric oxide and prostacyclin’s and in vascular smooth muscle cells it inhibits pro-contractile and pro-inflammatory signaling.\n Endothelial ACE2 is cleaved

Plasma ACE2 activity is increased in cardiovascular disease and may have prognostic significance in disease severity.\n In addition to its enzymatic function, ACE2 is the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV) and SARS-Cov-2, which cause SARS and coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) respectively.\n ACE-2 is thus a double-edged sword: it promotes cardiovascular health while also facilitating the devastations caused by coronaviruses.\n COVID-19 is associated with cardiovascular disease as a risk factor and as a complication.\n Mechanisms linking COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease are unclear, but vascular ACE2 may be important.\n This review focuses on the vascular biology and (patho)physiology of ACE2 in cardiovascular health and disease and briefly discusses the role of vascular ACE2 as a potential mediator of vascular injury in COVID-19.","id":"PMC7846970","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jithin","surname":"Kuriakose","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Augusto C.","surname":"Montezano","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rhian M.","surname":"Touyz","email":"rhian.touyz@glasgow.ac.uk","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1074/jbc.M505111200","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Tumor Necrosis Factor-?

E: from cardiovascular disease to neurodegenerative disorders","abstract":"Apolipoprotein (apo) E was initially described as a lipid transport protein and major ligand for low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors with a role in cholesterol metabolism and cardiovascular disease.\n It has since emerged as a major risk factor (causative gene) for Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.\n Detailed understanding of the structural features of the three isoforms (apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4), which differ by only a single amino acid interchange, has elucidated their unique functions.\n ApoE2 and apoE4 increase the risk for heart disease: apoE2 increases atherogenic lipoprotein levels (it binds poorly to LDL receptors), and apoE4 increases LDL levels (it binds preferentially to triglyceride-rich, very low density lipoproteins, leading to downregulation of LDL receptors).\n ApoE4 also increases the risk for neurodegenerative diseases, decreases their age of onset, or alters their progression.\n ApoE4 likely causes neurodegeneration secondary to its abnormal structure, caused by an interaction between its carboxyl- and amino-terminal domains, called domain interaction.\n When neurons are stressed or injured, they synthesize apoE to redistribute cholesterol for neuronal repair or remodeling.\n However, because of its altered structure, neuronal apoE4 undergoes neuron-specific proteolysis, generating neurotoxic fragments (12–29 kDa) that escape the secretory pathway and cause mitochondrial dysfunction and cytoskeletal alterations, including tau phosphorylation.\n ApoE4-associated pathology can be prevented by small-molecule structure correctors that block domain interaction by converting apoE4 to a molecule that resembles apoE3 both structurally and functionally.\n Structure correctors are a potential therapeutic approach to reduce apoE4 pathology in both cardiovascular and neurological disorders.\n","id":"PMC4921111","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Robert

pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n However, the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial activation in COVID-19 patients remain unclear.\n In this study, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells were screened to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in endothelial activation.\n It was found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 significantly activated human endothelial cells through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)/NF-?B and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.\n Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation.\n Remarkably, though the protein sequences of N proteins from coronaviruses are highly conserved, only NP from SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial activation.\n The NPs from other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), HUB1-CoV, and influenza virus H1N1 did not activate endothelial cells.\n These findings are consistent with the results from clinical investigations showing broad endotheliitis and organ injury in severe COVID-19 patients.\n In conclusion, the study provides insights on SARS-CoV-2-induced vasculopathy and coagulopathy and suggests that simvastatin, an FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug, may help prevent the pathogenesis and improve the

protect against oxidative damage.\n There is growing evidence to suggest that coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients exhibit a wide range of post-recovery symptoms and shows signs related to cardiovascular and specifically, endothelial damage.\n We hypothesized that these vascular symptoms might be associated with disrupted endothelial barrier integrity.\n This was investigated in vitro using endothelial cell culture and recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 Receptor-Binding Domain (Spike).\n Mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells from normal (C57BL/6 mice) and diabetic (db/db) mice were used.\n An endothelial transwell permeability assay revealed increased permeability in diabetic cells as well as after Spike treatment.\n The expression of VE-Cadherin, an endothelial adherens junction protein, JAM-A, a tight junctional protein, Connexin-43, a gap junctional protein, and PECAM-1, were all decreased significantly after Spike treatment in control and to a greater extent, in diabetic cells.\n In control cells, Spike treatment increased association of endothelial junctional proteins with Rab5a, a mediator of the endocytic trafficking compartment.\n In cerebral arteries isolated from control and diabetic animals, Spike protein had a greater effect in downregulating expression of endothelial junctional proteins in arteries from diabetic animals than from control animals.\n In conclusion, these experiments reveal that Spike-induced degradation of endothelial junctional proteins affects endothelial barrier function and is the likely cause of

This meta-analysis aims to investigate the relationship between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components with SARS and mortality in COVID-19 patients.\n Methods: A systematic search was conducted in the several databases up until 1 September 2021. Primary observational longitudinal studies published in peer review journals were selected.\n Two independent reviewers performed title and abstract screening, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale.\n Results: The random effects meta-analysis showed that MetS was significantly associated with SARS with a pooled OR (95% CI) of 3.21 (2.88–3.58) and mortality

Role of Platelet-Endothelium Interactions in the Pathogenesis of Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection-Associated Myocardial Injury","abstract":"Cardiovascular dysfunction and disease are common and frequently fatal complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\n Indeed, from early on during the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic it was recognized that cardiac complications may occur, even in patients with no underlying cardiac disorders, as part of the acute infection, and that these were associated with more severe disease and increased morbidity and mortality.\n The most common cardiac complication is acute cardiac injury, defined by significant elevation of cardiac troponins.\n The potential mechanisms of cardiovascular complications include direct viral myocardial injury, systemic inflammation induced by the virus, sepsis, arrhythmia, myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch, electrolyte abnormalities, and hypercoagulability.\n This review is focused on the prevalence, risk factors and clinical course of COVID-19-related myocardial injury, as well as on current data with regard to disease pathogenesis, specifically the interaction of platelets with the vascular endothelium.\n The latter section includes consideration of the role of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in triggering development of a generalized endotheliitis that, in turn, drives intense activation of platelets.\n Most prominently, SARS-CoV-2–induced endotheliitis involves interaction of the viral spike protein with endothelial angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) together with alternative mechanisms that involve the nucleocapsid and viroporin.\n In addition, the mechanisms by which activated platelets intensify endothelial activation and dysfunction, seemingly driven by release of the platelet-derived calcium-binding proteins, SA100A8 and SA100A9, are described.\n These events create a SARS-CoV-2–driven cycle of intravascular inflammation and coagulation, which contributes significantly to a poor clinical outcome in patients with severe disease.\n","id":"PMC8854752","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Theresa

started in the Western world, with the spread of the Western lifestyle across the globe, it has become now a truly global problem.\n The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is often more in the urban population of some developing countries than in its Western counterparts.\n The two basic forces spreading this malady are the increase in consumption of high calorie-low fiber fast food and the decrease in physical activity due to mechanized transportations and sedentary form of leisure time activities.\n The syndrome feeds into the spread of the diseases like type 2 diabetes, coronary diseases, stroke, and other disabilities.\n The total cost of the malady including the cost of health care and loss of potential economic activity is in trillions.\n The present trend is not sustainable unless a magic cure is found (unlikely) or concerted global/governmental/societal efforts are made to change the lifestyle that is promoting it.\n There are certainly some elements in the causation of the metabolic syndrome that cannot be changed but many are amenable for corrections and curtailments.\n For example, better urban planning to encourage active lifestyle, subsidizing

apoptosis-resistant and can express a pro-inflammatory, tissue-destructive senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).\n We recently reported that a component of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) surface protein, S1, can amplify the SASP of senescent cultured human cells and that a related mouse ?-coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), increases SASP factors and senescent cell burden in infected mice.\n Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 induces senescence in human non-senescent cells and exacerbates the SASP in human senescent cells through Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR-3).\n TLR-3, which senses viral RNA, was increased in human senescent compared to non-senescent cells.\n Notably, genetically or pharmacologically inhibiting TLR-3 prevented senescence induction and SASP amplification by SARS-CoV-2 or Spike pseudotyped virus.\n While an artificial TLR-3 agonist alone was not sufficient to induce senescence, it amplified the SASP in senescent human

cellular senescence and SASP amplification through TLR-3 contribute to SARS-CoV-2 morbidity, indicating that clinical trials of senolytics and/or SASP/TLR-3 inhibitors for alleviating acute and

and Laboratory Features of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Vis-À-Vis Onset of Fever","abstract":"Study objectives:\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a rapidly progressive disease caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) infection.\n\n However, the disease presentation is nonspecific.\n\n The aim of this study was to define clearly the presentation, clinical progression, and laboratory data in a group of patients who had SARS.\n\n\nDesign:\nRetrospective observational study.\n\n\nSetting:\nA tertiary care medical center with 51 negative-pressure isolation rooms in Taipei, Taiwan.\n\n\nPatients:\nFifty-three patients with SARS seen between April 27 and June 16, 2003.\nResults:\nFever (ie, temperature &gt; 38°C) was the most common symptom (98%) and the earliest.\n\n When admitted to the isolation unit of the hospital for observation, most patients reported nonspecific symptoms associated with their fever.\n\n Only two patients with preexisting illnesses had cough on the same day the fever began.\n\n Eventually, 39 patients (74%) developed cough, beginning at a mean (± SD) time of 4.5 ± 1.9 days after fever onset, and 35 patients (66%) had diarrhea beginning at a mean time of 6.0 ± 3.3 days after fever onset.\n\n Thirty-one patients (59%) had abnormal findings on chest radiographs on hospital admission, and all but 1 patient (98%) eventually developed lung infiltrates that were consistent with pneumonia.\n\n The majority of patients (63%) first developed unifocal infiltrates at a mean time of 4.5 ± 2.1 days after fever onset, while in 37% of patients the initial infiltrates were multifocal, appearing at a mean time of 5.8 ± 1.3 days after fever onset.\n\n Common laboratory findings included lymphopenia (on hospital admission, 70%; during hospitalization, 95%), thrombocytopenia (on hospital admission, 28%; during hospitalization, 40%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (on hospital admission, 58%; during hospitalization, 88%), creatine kinase (on hospital admission, 18%; during hospitalization, 32%), and aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase levels (on hospital admission, 27%; during hospitalization, 62%).\n\n Throat or nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR was positive in 40 of the 47 patients (85%) in whom the test was performed.\n\n\nConclusions:\nNone of the presenting symptoms or laboratory findings are pathognomonic for SARS.\n\n Even though cough developed in a majority of patients, it did not occur until later in the disease course, suggesting that a cough preceding or concurrent with the onset of fever is less likely to indicate SARS.\n\n While PCR for SARS-CoV appears to be the best early diagnostic test currently available, it is clear that better methods are needed to differentiate between SARS and non-SARS illness on initial presentation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7094461","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ching-Lung","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yen-Ta","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Meng-Jen","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pei-Jan","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rong-Luh","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chien-Liang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hsu-Tah","surname":"Kuo","email":"kuohsu@ms2.mmh.org.tw","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/cid/cis733","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Population-based

China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients),

rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41

(one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients

[94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%)

report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical

city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

mortality in critical illness: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Introduction\nThe neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biological marker that has been shown to be associated with outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

died by Jan 31, 2020.

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had

a hallmark of MERS-CoV infection.\n The clinical features associated with MERS-CoV infection are not MERS-specific and are similar to other respiratory tract infections.\n Thus, the diagnosis of MERS can easily be missed, unless the doctor or health-care worker has a high degree of clinical awareness and the patient undergoes specific testing for MERS-CoV.\n The largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in South Korea in May, 2015, resulting in 186 cases with 38 deaths.\n This outbreak was caused by a traveller with undiagnosed MERS-CoV infection who became ill

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes.\n Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV.\n The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses.\n However, the external subdomain of Spike’s receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses.\n Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein.\n Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands.\n Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus.\n These findings provide the basis for starting further studies on the pathogenesis, and optimizing the design of diagnostic, antiviral and vaccination strategies for this emerging infection.\n","id":"PMC7067204","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jasper

levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of Sciences,

of incubation period are often poorly referenced, inconsistent, or based on limited data.\n In a systematic review of the literature on nine respiratory viral infections of public-health importance, we identified 436 articles with statements of incubation period and 38 with data for pooled analysis.\n We fitted a log-normal distribution to pooled data and found the median incubation period to be 5·6 days (95% CI 4·8–6·3) for adenovirus, 3·2 days (95% CI 2·8–3·7) for human coronavirus, 4·0 days (95% CI 3·6–4·4) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 1·4 days (95% CI 1·3–1·5) for influenza A, 0·6 days (95% CI 0·5–0·6) for influenza B, 12·5 days (95% CI 11·8–13·3) for measles, 2·6 days (95% CI 2·1–3·1) for parainfluenza, 4·4 days (95% CI 3·9–4·9) for respiratory syncytial

for likely times and sources of infection, and the full distribution for models used in pandemic planning.\n Our estimates combine published data to give the detail necessary for these and other

novel coronavirus (CoV).\n\n Clinical data on MERS-CoV infections are scarce.\n\n We report epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of 47 cases of MERS-CoV infections, identify knowledge gaps, and define research priorities.\n\n\nMethods\nWe abstracted and analysed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from confirmed cases of sporadic, household, community, and health-care-associated MERS-CoV infections reported from Saudi Arabia between Sept 1, 2012, and June 15, 2013. Cases were confirmed as having MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n\nFindings\n47 individuals (46 adults, one child) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV disease were identified; 36 (77%) were male (male:female ratio 3·3:1).\n\n 28 patients died, a 60% case-fatality rate.\n\n The case-fatality rate rose with increasing age.\n\n Only two of the 47 cases were previously healthy; most patients (45 [96%]) had underlying comorbid medical disorders, including diabetes (32 [68%]), hypertension (16 [34%]), chronic cardiac disease (13 [28%]), and chronic renal disease (23 [49%]).\n\n Common symptoms at presentation were fever (46 [98%]), fever with chills or rigors (41 [87%]), cough (39 [83%]), shortness of breath (34 [72%]), and myalgia (15 [32%]).\n\n Gastrointestinal symptoms were also frequent, including diarrhoea (12 [26%]), vomiting (ten [21%]), and abdominal pain (eight [17%]).\n\n All patients had abnormal findings on chest radiography, ranging from subtle to extensive unilateral and bilateral abnormalities.\n\n Laboratory analyses showed raised concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (23 [49%]) and aspartate aminotransferase (seven [15%]) and thrombocytopenia (17 [36%]) and lymphopenia (16 [34%]).\n\n\nInterpretation\nDisease caused by MERS-CoV presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations and is associated with substantial mortality in admitted patients who have medical comorbidities.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology, community prevalence, and clinical spectrum of infection and disease need urgent

clinical pathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): a report from China","abstract":"In order to investigate the clinical pathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the autopsies of three patients who died from SARS in Nan Fang Hospital Guangdong, China were studied retrospectively.\n Routine haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining was used to study all of the tissues from the three cases.\n The lung tissue specimens were studied further with Macchiavello staining, viral inclusion body staining, reticulin staining, PAS staining, immunohistochemistry, ultrathin sectioning and staining, light microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.\n The first symptom was hyperpyrexia in all three cases, followed by progressive dyspnoea and lung field shadowing.\n The pulmonary lesions included bilateral extensive consolidation, localized haemorrhage and necrosis, desquamative pulmonary alveolitis and bronchitis, proliferation and desquamation of alveolar epithelial cells, exudation of protein and monocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells in alveoli, hyaline membrane formation, and viral inclusion bodies in alveolar epithelial cells.\n There was also massive necrosis of splenic lymphoid tissue and localized necrosis in lymph nodes.\n Systemic vasculitis included oedema, localized fibrinoid necrosis, and infiltration of monocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells into vessel walls in the heart, lung, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, and the stroma of striated muscles.\n Thrombosis was present in small veins.\n Systemic toxic changes included degeneration and necrosis of the parenchyma cells in the lung, liver, kidney, heart, and adrenal gland.\n Electron microscopy demonstrated clusters of viral particles, consistent with coronavirus, in lung tissue.\n SARS is a systemic disease that injures many organs.\n The lungs, immune organs, and systemic small vessels are the main targets of virus attack, so that extensive consolidation of the lung, diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation, respiratory distress, and decreased immune function are the main causes of death.\n Copyright © 2003 John Wiley &amp; Sons,

but no approved therapeutics are available.\n The CoV nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN) has complicated development of antiviral nucleosides due to its proofreading activity.\n We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs in vitro and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model.\n However, studies with GS-5734 have not reported resistance associated with GS-5734, nor do we understand the action of GS-5734 in wild-type (WT) proofreading CoVs.\n Here, we show that GS-5734 inhibits murine hepatitis virus (MHV) with similar 50% effective concentration values (EC50) as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n Passage of WT MHV in the presence of the GS-5734 parent nucleoside selected two mutations in the nsp12 polymerase at residues conserved across all CoVs that conferred up to 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734, as determined by EC50.\n The resistant viruses were unable to compete with WT in direct coinfection passage in the absence of GS-5734. Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same in vitro resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model.\n Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734. Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging

known about the recognition of HSV1 by NK cells, and describe a novel mechanism of innate immune surveillance against certain viral pathogens by NK cells called Fc-bridged cell-mediated

Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

Trial of Lopinavir–Ritonavir in Adults Hospitalized with Severe Covid-19","abstract":"Background\nNo therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n

Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin are all examples of therapeutic agents, whose efficacy against COVID-19 was later disproved.\n Meanwhile, concentrated efforts of researchers and clinicians worldwide have led to the identification of novel therapeutic options to control the disease including PAXLOVID™ (PF-07321332).\n Although COVID-19 cases are currently treated using a comprehensive approach of anticoagulants, oxygen, and antibiotics, the novel Pfizer agent PAXLOVID™ (PF-07321332), an investigational COVID-19 oral antiviral candidate, significantly reduced hospitalization time and death rates, based on an interim analysis of the phase 2/3 EPIC-HR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients) randomized, double-blind study of non-hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19, who are at high risk of progressing to severe illness.\n The scheduled interim analysis demonstrated an 89 % reduction in risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause compared to placebo in patients treated within three days of symptom onset (primary endpoint).\n However, there still exists a great need for the development of additional treatments, as the recommended therapeutic options are insufficient in many cases.\n Thus far, mRNA and vector vaccines appear to be the most effective modalities to control the pandemic.\n In the current review, we provide an update on the progress that has been made since April 2020 in clinical trials concerning the effectiveness of therapies available to combat COVID-19. We focus on currently recommended therapeutic agents, including steroids, various monoclonal antibodies, remdesivir, baricitinib, anticoagulants and PAXLOVID™ summarizing the latest original studies and meta-analyses.\n Moreover, we aim to discuss other currently and previously studied agents targeting COVID-19 that either show no or only limited therapeutic activity.\n The results of recent studies report that hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma demonstrate no efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n Lastly, we summarize the studies on various drugs with incoherent or insufficient data concerning their effectiveness, such as amantadine, ivermectin, or niclosamide.\n","id":"PMC8654464","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sylwester","surname":"Dro?d?al","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jakub","surname":"Rosik","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kacper","surname":"Lechowicz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Filip","surname":"Machaj","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bartosz","surname":"Szostak","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jaros?aw","surname":"Przybyci?ski","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shahrokh","surname":"Lorzadeh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Katarzyna","surname":"Kotfis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Saeid","surname":"Ghavami","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marek

(RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial","abstract":"Background\nCasirivimab and imdevimab are non-competing monoclonal antibodies that bind to two different sites on the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, blocking viral entry into host cells.\n\n We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of casirivimab and imdevimab administered in combination in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nMethods\nRECOVERY is a randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial comparing several possible treatments with usual care in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. 127 UK hospitals took part in the evaluation of casirivimab and imdevimab.\n\n Eligible participants were any patients aged at least 12 years admitted to hospital with clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either usual standard of care alone or usual care plus casirivimab 4 g and imdevimab 4 g administered together in a single intravenous infusion.\n\n Investigators and data assessors were masked to analyses of the outcome data during the trial.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality assessed by intention to treat, first only in patients without detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 infection at randomisation (ie, those who were seronegative) and then in the overall population.\n\n Safety was assessed in all participants who received casirivimab and imdevimab.\n\n The trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov (NCT04381936).\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Sept 18, 2020, and May 22, 2021, 9785 patients enrolled in RECOVERY were eligible for casirivimab and imdevimab, of which 4839 were randomly assigned to casirivimab and imdevimab plus usual care and 4946 to usual care alone.\n\n 3153 (32%) of 9785 patients were seronegative, 5272 (54%) were seropositive, and 1360 (14%) had unknown baseline antibody status.\n\n 812 (8%) patients were known to have received at least one dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.\n\n In the primary efficacy population of seronegative patients, 396 (24%) of 1633 patients allocated to casirivimab and imdevimab versus 452 (30%) of 1520 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio [RR] 0·79, 95% CI 0·69–0·91; p=0·0009).\n\n In an analysis of all randomly assigned patients (regardless of baseline antibody status), 943 (19%) of 4839 patients allocated to casirivimab and imdevimab versus 1029 (21%) of 4946 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (RR 0·94, 95% CI 0·86–1·02; p=0·14).\n\n The proportional effect of casirivimab and imdevimab on mortality differed significantly between seropositive and seronegative patients (p value for heterogeneity=0·002).\n\n There were no deaths attributed to the treatment, or meaningful between-group differences in the pre-specified safety outcomes of cause-specific mortality, cardiac arrhythmia, thrombosis, or major bleeding events.\n\n Serious adverse reactions reported in seven (&lt;1%) participants were believed by the local investigator to be related to treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, the monoclonal antibody combination of casirivimab and imdevimab reduced 28-day mortality in patients who were seronegative (and therefore had not mounted their own humoral immune response) at baseline but not in those who were seropositive at baseline.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Research and Innovation

antibodies","abstract":"id='Par1'>The SARS-CoV-2 B.\n1.1.529 (Omicron) variant contains 15 mutations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD).\n How Omicron evades RBD-targeted neutralizing antibodies requires immediate investigation.\n Here we use high-throughput yeast display screening1,2 to determine the profiles of RBD escaping mutations for 247 human anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies and show that the neutralizing antibodies can be classified by unsupervised clustering into six epitope groups (A–F)—a grouping that is highly concordant with knowledge-based structural classifications3–5.\n Various single mutations of Omicron can impair neutralizing antibodies of different epitope groups.\n Specifically, neutralizing antibodies in groups A–D, the epitopes of which overlap with the ACE2-binding motif, are largely escaped by K417N, G446S, E484A and Q493R.\n Antibodies in group E (for example, S309)6 and group F (for example, CR3022)7, which often exhibit broad sarbecovirus neutralizing activity, are less affected by Omicron, but a subset of neutralizing antibodies are still escaped by G339D, N440K and S371L.\n Furthermore, Omicron pseudovirus neutralization showed that neutralizing antibodies that sustained single mutations could also be escaped, owing to multiple synergetic mutations on their epitopes.\n In total, over 85% of the tested neutralizing antibodies were escaped by Omicron.\n With regard to neutralizing-antibody-based drugs, the neutralization potency of LY-CoV016, LY-CoV555, REGN10933, REGN10987, AZD1061, AZD8895 and BRII-196 was greatly undermined by Omicron, whereas VIR-7831 and DXP-604 still functioned at a reduced efficacy.\n Together, our data suggest that infection with Omicron would result in considerable humoral immune evasion, and that neutralizing antibodies targeting the sarbecovirus conserved region will remain most effective.\n Our results inform the development of antibody-based drugs and vaccines against Omicron and future variants.\n","id":"PMC8866119","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yunlong","surname":"Cao","email":"yunlongcao@pku.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fanchong","surname":"Jian","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Fanchong","surname":"Jian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tianhe","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Tianhe","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Weiliang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ayijiang","surname":"Yisimayi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Weijin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qianqian","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Qianqian","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ran","surname":"An","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao","surname":"Niu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sijie","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Haiyan","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuanling","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qianqian","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shuo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaodong","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shuo","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhiying","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zhiying","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaohua","surname":"Hao","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xiaohua","surname":"Hao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ronghua","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiangxi","surname":"Wang","email":"xiangxi@ibp.ac.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Junyu","surname":"Xiao","email":"junyuxiao@pku.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Youchun","surname":"Wang","email":"wangyc@nifdc.org.cn","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Youchun","surname":"Wang","email":"wangyc@nifdc.org.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoliang

to facilitate its infection.\n Here, we first discover an interaction between host cell receptor CD147 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.\n The loss of CD147 or blocking CD147 in Vero E6 and BEAS-2B cell lines by anti-CD147 antibody, Meplazumab, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 amplification.\n Expression of human CD147 allows virus entry into non-susceptible BHK-21 cells, which can be neutralized by CD147 extracellular fragment.\n Viral loads are detectable in the lungs of human CD147 (hCD147) mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, but not in those of virus-infected wild type mice.\n Interestingly, virions are observed in lymphocytes of lung tissue from a COVID-19 patient.\n Human T cells with a property of ACE2 natural deficiency can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in a dose-dependent manner, which is specifically inhibited by Meplazumab.\n Furthermore, CD147 mediates virus entering host cells by endocytosis.\n Together, our study reveals a novel virus entry route, CD147-spike protein, which provides an important target for developing specific and effective drug against COVID-19.","id":"PMC7714896","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ke","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zheng","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jian-Qi","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ding","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiu-Xuan","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Gong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xu","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiwei","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jie-Jie","surname":"Geng","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Jie-Jie","surname":"Geng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruo","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Hai","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yu-Meng","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Nan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jian-Li","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ling","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jiao","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Wan","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Liangzhi","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Hui","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Jin-Lin","surname":"Miao","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Hong-Yong","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ling","surname":"Fu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ling","surname":"Fu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiang-Min","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zhongpeng","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shihui","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hongjing","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhe","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Chun-Fu","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yacheng","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ying-Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qing-Yi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Huijie","surname":"Bian","email":"hjbian@fmmu.edu.cn","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Ping","surname":"Zhu","email":"zhuping@fmmu.edu.cn","contributions":"6"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Nan","surname":"Chen","email":"znchen@fmmu.edu.cn","contributions":"4"}]},{"doi":"10.1186/s13578-022-00822-6","date":"2022-05-27","title":"Development of a novel human CD147 knock-in NSG mouse model to test SARS-CoV-2 viral infection","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>An animal model that can mimic the SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is critical to understanding the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus and for development of prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat emerging mutants.\n\n Studies show that the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2, a well-recognized, functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) to mediate viral entry.\n\n Several hACE2 transgenic (hACE2Tg) mouse models are being widely used, which are clearly invaluable.\n\n However, the hACE2Tg mouse model cannot fully explain: (1) low expression of ACE2 observed in human lung and heart, but lung or heart failure occurs frequently in severe COVID-19 patients; (2) low expression of ACE2 on immune cells, but lymphocytopenia occurs frequently in COVID-19 patients; and (3) hACE2Tg mice do not mimic the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.\n\n Moreover, one of most outstanding features of coronavirus infection is the diversity of receptor usage, which includes the newly proposed human CD147 (hCD147) as a possible co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry.\n\n It is still debatable whether CD147 can serve as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection or entry.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par2'>Here we successfully generated a hCD147 knock-in mouse model (hCD147KI) in the NOD-scid IL2Rgammanull (NSG) background.\n\n In this hCD147KI-NSG mouse model, the hCD147 genetic sequence was placed downstream of the endogenous mouse promoter for mouse CD147 (mCD147), which creates an in vivo model that may better recapitulate physiological expression of hCD147 proteins at the molecular level compared to the existing and well-studied K18-hACE2-B6 (JAX) model.\n\n In addition, the hCD147KI-NSG mouse model allows further study of SARS-CoV-2 in the immunodeficiency condition which may assist our understanding of this virus in the context of high-risk populations in immunosuppressed states.\n\n Our data show (1) the human CD147 protein is expressed in various organs (including bronchiolar epithelial cells) in hCD147KI-NSG mice by immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry; (2) hCD147KI-NSG mice are marginally sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to WT-NSG littermates characterized by increased viral copies by qRT-PCR and moderate body weight decline compared to baseline; (3) a significant increase in leukocytes in the lungs of hCD147KI-NSG mice, compared to infected WT-NSG mice.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par3'>hCD147KI-NSG mice are more sensitive to COVID-19 infection compared to WT-NSG mice.\n\n The hCD147KI-NSG mouse model can serve as an additional animal model for further interrogation whether CD147 serve as an independent functional receptor or accessory receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and immune responses.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at

humanized CD147 transgenic mice were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and its two variants, alpha and beta.\n When infected, these mice developed exudative alveolar pneumonia, featured by immune responses involving alveoli-infiltrated macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes and activation of IL-17 signaling pathway.\n Mechanistically, we proposed that severe COVID-19-related cytokine storm is induced by a “spike protein-CD147-CyPA signaling axis”: Infection of SARS-CoV-2 through CD147 initiated the JAK-STAT pathway, which further induced expression of cyclophilin A (CyPA); CyPA reciprocally bound to CD147 and triggered MAPK pathway.\n Consequently, the MAPK pathway regulated the expression of cytokines and chemokines, which promoted the development of cytokine storm.\n Importantly, Meplazumab

symptomatic and for activating public health measures.\n Antigen rapid detection tests detect viral proteins and, although they are less sensitive than molecular tests, have the advantages of being easier to do, giving a faster time to result, of being lower cost, and able to detect infection in those who are most likely to be at risk of transmitting the virus to others.\n Antigen rapid detection tests can be used as a public health tool for screening individuals at enhanced risk of infection, to protect people who are clinically vulnerable, to ensure safe travel and the resumption of schooling and social activities, and to enable economic recovery.\n With vaccine roll-out, antibody tests (which detect the host's response to infection or vaccination) can be useful surveillance tools to inform public policy, but should not be used to provide proof of immunity, as the correlates of protection remain unclear.\n All three types of COVID-19 test continue to have a crucial role

17-year-old male with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) secondary to COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nCase report\nThis patient presented with cough, sore throat, anorexia and pyrexia.\n\n On examination, he had gross cervical lymphadenopathy and palpable splenomegaly.\n\n Nose and throat swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive and blood tests revealed pancytopaenia with very high ferritin, triglyceride and d-dimer levels.\n\n The patient's H-Score [2] was calculated at 220, suggesting probability of HLH of 93–96%.\n\n Considering Russell and colleagues' [3] comments about potential harm of corticosteroid use in patients with COVID-19 infection, the patient was commenced on treatment with the selective IL-1 receptor antagonist drug, Anakinra, and a two-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin.\n\n\nResults\nThe patient responded rapidly to treatment, becoming apyrexial after 24?h.\n\n His lymph nodes and spleen began to normalise after the first 48?h, at which time point the ferritin also started to decrease.\n\n He was discharged after 11?days feeling fit and well.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis case certainly illustrates the importance of hyperinflammation syndromes in COVID-19. It also raises the question – is the severe pneumonitis seen in patients with COVID-19 an immunological phenomenon? We know that the viral load of patients with COVID-19 seems to peak in the early stages of illness [4,5]; however, patients deteriorate later in the disease course, at around days 10–14. This patient, who had risk factors for deterioration (male, pancytopaenic), did not develop an oxygen requirement and clinically and biochemically improved rapidly on Anakinra with no adverse events.\n\n We might suggest Anakinra to the scientific community as a treatment option in COVID-19 infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7245680","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kathryn","surname":"Haigh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zoe

Sex-specific expression patterns of proteins mediating virus binding and entry, and divergent reactions of the immune and endocrine system, in particular the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, in response to acute stress might explain the higher severity of COVID-19 in men.\n In this Personal View, we discuss how sex hormones, comorbidities, and the sex chromosome complement influence these

Due to its role in the severity and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infections, we argue that sexual dimorphism has potential implications for disease treatment, public health measures, and follow-up of

cardiovascular comorbidities","abstract":"The high mortality rate of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a critical concern of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.\n Strikingly, men account for the majority of COVID-19 deaths, with current figures ranging from 59% to 75% of total mortality.\n However, despite clear implications in relation to COVID-19 mortality, most research has not considered sex as a critical factor in data analysis.\n Here, we highlight fundamental biological differences that exist between males and females, and how these may make significant contributions to the male-biased COVID-19 mortality.\n We present preclinical evidence identifying the influence of biological sex on the expression and regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the main receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells.\n However, we note that there is a lack of reports showing that sexual dimorphism of ACE2 expression exists and is of functional relevance in humans.\n In contrast, there is strong evidence, especially in the context of viral infections, that sexual dimorphism plays a central role in the genetic and hormonal regulation of immune responses, both of the innate and the adaptive immune system.\n We review evidence supporting that ineffective anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses, coupled with a predisposition for inappropriate hyperinflammatory responses, could provide a biological explanation for the male bias in COVID-19 mortality.\n A prominent finding in COVID-19 is the increased risk of death with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension, obesity, and age.\n We contextualize how important features of sexual dimorphism and inflammation in COVID-19 may exhibit a reciprocal relationship with comorbidities, and explain their increased mortality risk.\n Ultimately, we demonstrate that biological sex is a fundamental variable of critical relevance to our mechanistic understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the pursuit of effective COVID-19 preventative and therapeutic strategies.\n","id":"PMC7665363","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Laura

manifestations, including death.\n\n Several studies and meta-analyses have evaluated the role of hypertension on prognosis, but with important limitations and conflicting results.\n\n Therefore, we decided to perform a new meta-analysis of the observational studies that explored the relationship between pre-existing hypertension and mortality risk in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, using more stringent inclusion criteria to overcome the limitations inherent previous meta-analyses.\n\n\nMethods\nA systematic search of the on-line databases available up to 31 March 2022 was conducted, including peer-reviewed original articles, involving the adult population, where the role of hypertension on mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by Cox-proportional hazard models.\n\n Pooled hazard ratio (HR) was calculated by a random effect model.\n\n Sensitivity, heterogeneity, publication bias, subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-six studies (222,083 participants) met the pre-defined inclusion criteria.\n\n In the pooled analysis, pre-existing hypertension was significantly associated with mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection,

Many epidemiologic studies have been conducted since that time concluding that SARS-CoV-2 increased the incidence of myocarditis/pericarditis at least 15× over pre-COVID levels although the condition remains rare.\n The incidence of myocarditis pre-COVID was reported at 1 to 10 cases/100 000 individuals and with COVID ranging from 150 to 4000 cases/100 000 individuals.\n Before COVID-19, some vaccines were reported to cause myocarditis and pericarditis in rare cases, but the use of novel mRNA platforms led to a higher number of reported cases than with previous platforms providing new insight into potential pathogenic mechanisms.\n The incidence of COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis/pericarditis covers a large range depending on the vaccine platform, age, and sex examined.\n Importantly, the findings highlight that myocarditis occurs predominantly in male patients aged 12 to 40 years regardless of whether the cause was due to a virus-like SARS-CoV-2 or associated with a vaccine—a demographic that has been reported before COVID-19. This review discusses findings from COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis and pericarditis considering the known symptoms, diagnosis, management, treatment, and pathogenesis of disease that has been gleaned from clinical research and animal models.\n Sex differences in the immune response to COVID-19 are discussed, and theories for how mRNA vaccines could lead to myocarditis/pericarditis are proposed.\n Additionally, gaps in our understanding that need further research are raised.\n","id":"PMC10171304","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"DeLisa","surname":"Fairweather","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Danielle

COVID-19 is the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a virus that targets not only the lungs but also the cardiovascular system.\n COVID-19 can manifest with a wide range of clinical manifestations, from mild symptoms to severe forms of the disease, characterized by respiratory failure due to severe alveolar damage.\n Several studies investigated the underlying mechanisms of the severe lung damage associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and revealed that the respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 is the consequence not only of acute respiratory distress syndrome but also of macro- and

(ACE2) is a type I integral membrane that exists in two forms: the first is a transmembrane protein; the second is a soluble catalytic ectodomain of ACE2. The catalytic ectodomain of ACE2 undergoes shedding by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17), in which calmodulin mediates the calcium signaling pathway that is involved in ACE2 release, resulting in a soluble catalytic ectodomain of ACE2 that can be measured as soluble ACE2 plasma activity.\n The shedding of the ACE2 catalytic ectodomain plays a role in cardiac remodeling and endothelial dysfunction and is a predictor of all-cause mortality, including cardiovascular mortality.\n Moreover, considerable evidence supports that the ACE2 catalytic ectodomain is an essential entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\n Additionally, endotoxins and the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1? and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF?) all enhanced soluble catalytic ectodomain ACE2 shedding from the airway epithelia, suggesting that the shedding of ACE2 may represent a mechanism by which viral entry and infection may be controlled such as some types of betacoronavirus.\n In this regard, ACE2 plays an important role in inflammation and thrombotic response, and its down-regulation may aggravate COVID-19 via the renin-angiotensin system, including by promoting pathological changes in lung injury.\n Soluble forms of ACE2 have recently been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n Furthermore, given that vitamin D enhanced the shedding of ACE2, some studies reported that vitamin D treatment is associated with prognosis improvement in COVID-19.

receptor.\n ACE2 is widely expressed, including, in the lungs, cardiovascular system, gut, kidneys, central nervous system, and adipose tissue.\n ACE2 has recently been identified as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the infective agent responsible for coronavirus disease 2019, providing a critical link between immunity, inflammation, ACE2, and cardiovascular disease.\n Although sharing a close

trends and predictors of in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19 and PE in Germany.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used a German nationwide inpatient sample to analyse data on hospitalisations among COVID-19 patients with and without PE during 2020, and to detect changes in PE prevalence and case fatality in comparison with 2019.\nResults\nWe analysed 176?137 COVID-19 hospitalisations in 2020; PE was

(17.7%).\n\n Between 2019 and 2020, numbers of PE-related hospitalisations were largely unchanged (98?485 versus 97?718), whereas the case fatality rate of PE increased slightly in 2020 (from 12.7% to

COVID-19 metabolic regulation.\n In this study we highlight the involvement of obesity metabolically in affecting SARS-CoV-2 infection and the consequent health complications, mainly cardiovascular disease.\n We measured one hundred and forty-four (144) metabolites using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) to identify metabolic changes in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, in lean and obese COVID-19 positive (n=82) and COVID-19 negative (n=24) patients.\n The identified metabolites are found to be mainly correlating with glucose, energy and steroid metabolisms.\n Further data analysis indicated twelve (12) significantly yet differentially abundant metabolites associated with viral infection and health complications, in COVID-19 obese patients.\n Two of the detected metabolites, n6-acetyl-l-lysine and p-cresol, are detected only among the COVID-19 cohort, exhibiting significantly higher levels in COVID-19 obese patients when compared to COVID-19 lean patients.\n These metabolites have important roles in viral entry and could explain the increased susceptibility of obese patients.\n On the same note, a set of six metabolites associated with antiviral and anti-inflammatory functions displayed significantly lower abundance in COVID-19 obese patients.\n In conclusion, this report highlights the plasma metabolome of COVID-19 obese patients as a metabolic feature and signature to help improve clinical outcomes.\n We propose n6-acetyl-l-lysine and p-cresol as potential metabolic markers which warrant further investigations to better understand their involvement in different metabolic pathways in COVID-19.","id":"PMC9161728","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nour","surname":"Jalaleddine","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mahmood","surname":"Hachim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hamza","surname":"Al-Hroub","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Narjes","surname":"Saheb

coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection is one of the key determinants of COVID-19 severity and mortality.\n SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells is initiated by binding with its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, and the ACE2 abundance is thought to reflect the susceptibility to infection.\n Here, we report that ibudilast, which we previously identified as a potent inhibitor of protein complex between transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) 3 and NADPH oxidase (Nox) 2, attenuates the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein pseudovirus-evoked contractile and metabolic dysfunctions of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs).\n Epidemiologically reported risk factors of severe COVID-19, including cigarette sidestream smoke (CSS) and anti-cancer drug treatment, commonly upregulate ACE2 expression level, and these were suppressed by inhibiting TRPC3-Nox2 complex formation.\n Exposure of NRCMs to SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, as well as CSS and doxorubicin (Dox), induces ATP release through pannexin-1 hemi-channels, and this ATP release potentiates pseudovirus entry to NRCMs and human iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs).\n As the pseudovirus entry followed by production of reactive oxygen species was attenuated by inhibiting TRPC3-Nox2 complex in hiPS-CMs, we suggest that TRPC3-Nox2 complex formation triggered by panexin1-mediated ATP release participates in exacerbation of myocardial

preferentially to triglyceride-rich, very low density lipoproteins, leading to downregulation of LDL receptors).\n ApoE4 also increases the risk for neurodegenerative diseases, decreases their age of onset, or alters their progression.\n ApoE4 likely causes neurodegeneration secondary to its abnormal structure, caused by an interaction between its carboxyl- and amino-terminal domains, called domain interaction.\n When neurons are stressed or injured, they synthesize apoE to redistribute cholesterol for neuronal repair or remodeling.\n However, because of its altered structure, neuronal apoE4 undergoes neuron-specific proteolysis, generating neurotoxic fragments (12–29 kDa) that escape the secretory pathway and cause mitochondrial dysfunction and cytoskeletal alterations, including tau phosphorylation.\n ApoE4-associated pathology can be prevented by small-molecule structure correctors that block domain interaction by converting apoE4 to a molecule that resembles apoE3 both

imbalance between an exacerbated oxidative stress (plasma peroxides levels in ICU patients vs.\n\n controls: 1456.0 ± 400.2 vs 436 ± 272.1 mmol/L; P &lt; 0.05) and a reduced nitric oxide

activation in COVID-19 patients remain unclear.\n In this study, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells were screened to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in endothelial activation.\n It was found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 significantly activated human endothelial cells through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)/NF-?B and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.\n Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation.\n Remarkably, though the protein sequences of N proteins from coronaviruses are highly conserved, only NP from SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial activation.\n The NPs from other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), HUB1-CoV, and influenza virus H1N1 did not activate endothelial cells.\n These findings are consistent with the results from clinical investigations showing broad endotheliitis and organ injury in severe COVID-19 patients.\n In conclusion, the

protect against oxidative damage.\n There is growing evidence to suggest that coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients exhibit a wide range of post-recovery symptoms and shows signs related to cardiovascular and specifically, endothelial damage.\n We hypothesized that these vascular symptoms might be associated with disrupted endothelial barrier integrity.\n This was investigated in vitro using endothelial cell culture and recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 Receptor-Binding Domain (Spike).\n Mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells from normal (C57BL/6 mice) and diabetic (db/db) mice were used.\n An endothelial transwell permeability assay revealed increased permeability in diabetic cells as well as after Spike treatment.\n The expression of VE-Cadherin, an endothelial adherens junction protein, JAM-A, a tight junctional protein, Connexin-43, a gap junctional protein, and PECAM-1, were all decreased significantly after Spike treatment in control and to a greater extent, in diabetic cells.\n In control cells, Spike treatment increased association of endothelial junctional proteins with Rab5a, a mediator of the endocytic trafficking compartment.\n In cerebral arteries isolated from control and diabetic animals, Spike protein had a greater effect in downregulating expression of endothelial junctional proteins in arteries from diabetic animals than from control animals.\n In conclusion, these experiments reveal that Spike-induced degradation of endothelial junctional proteins affects endothelial barrier function and is the likely cause of

Role of Platelet-Endothelium Interactions in the Pathogenesis of Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection-Associated Myocardial Injury","abstract":"Cardiovascular dysfunction and disease are common and frequently fatal complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\n Indeed, from early on during the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic it was recognized that cardiac complications may occur, even in patients with no underlying cardiac disorders, as part of the acute infection, and that these were associated with more severe disease and increased morbidity and mortality.\n The most common cardiac complication is acute cardiac injury, defined by significant elevation of cardiac troponins.\n The potential mechanisms of cardiovascular complications include direct viral myocardial injury, systemic inflammation induced by the virus, sepsis, arrhythmia, myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch, electrolyte abnormalities, and hypercoagulability.\n This review is focused on the prevalence, risk factors and clinical course of COVID-19-related myocardial injury, as well as on current data with regard to disease pathogenesis, specifically the interaction of platelets with the vascular endothelium.\n The latter section includes consideration of the role of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in triggering development of a generalized endotheliitis that, in turn, drives intense activation of platelets.\n Most prominently, SARS-CoV-2–induced endotheliitis involves interaction of the viral spike protein with endothelial angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) together with alternative mechanisms that involve the nucleocapsid and viroporin.\n In addition, the mechanisms by which activated platelets intensify endothelial activation and dysfunction, seemingly driven by release of the platelet-derived calcium-binding proteins, SA100A8 and SA100A9, are described.\n These events create a SARS-CoV-2–driven cycle of intravascular inflammation and coagulation, which contributes significantly to a poor clinical outcome in patients with severe disease.\n","id":"PMC8854752","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Theresa

decrease in physical activity due to mechanized transportations and sedentary form of leisure time activities.\n The syndrome feeds into the spread of the diseases like type 2 diabetes, coronary

nonetheless, there are remaining challenges and emerging questions in the field.\n In this article, we aim to summarize the latest information on the impact of the pandemic on blood pressure control, the use of the renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in patients with COVID-19, and the blood pressure changes as one of the possible post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (also known as long COVID).\n We also summarize the evidence of telemedicine and COVID-19 vaccination in hypertensive subjects, based on data available as of June 2022.","id":"PMC9780104","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Shigeru","surname":"Shibata","email":"shigeru.shibata@med.teikyo-u.ac.jp","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kazuo","surname":"Kobayashi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Masami","surname":"Tanaka","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kei","surname":"Asayama","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eiichiro","surname":"Yamamoto","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hironori","surname":"Nakagami","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Satoshi","surname":"Hoshide","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Takuya","surname":"Kishi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chisa","surname":"Matsumoto","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Masaki","surname":"Mogi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Satoshi","surname":"Morimoto","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Koichi","surname":"Yamamoto","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Masashi","surname":"Mukoyama","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kazuomi","surname":"Kario","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Koichi","surname":"Node","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hiromi","surname":"Rakugi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.metabol.2022.155236","date":"2022-06-01","title":"SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs the insulin/IGF signaling pathway in the lung, liver, adipose tissue, and pancreatic cells via IRF1","abstract":"Background\nCOVID-19 can cause multiple organ damages as well as metabolic abnormalities such as hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and new onset of diabetes.\n\n The insulin/IGF signaling pathway plays an important role in regulating energy metabolism and cell survival, but little is known about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n The aim of this work was to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs the insulin/IGF signaling pathway in the host cell/tissue, and if so, the potential mechanism and association with COVID-19 pathology.\n\n\nMethods\nTo determine the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on insulin/IGF signaling pathway, we utilized transcriptome datasets of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and tissues from public repositories for a wide range of high-throughput gene expression data: autopsy lungs from COVID-19 patients compared to the control from non-COVID-19 patients; lungs from a human ACE2 transgenic mouse infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the control infected with mock; human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived liver organoids infected with SARS-CoV-2; adipose tissues from a mouse model of COVID-19 overexpressing human ACE2 via adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) compared to the control GFP after SARS-CoV-2 infection; iPS-derived human pancreatic cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the mock control.\n\n Gain and loss of IRF1 function models were established in HEK293T and/or Calu3 cells to evaluate the impact on insulin signaling.\n\n To understand the mechanistic regulation and relevance with COVID-19 risk factors, such as older age, male sex, obesity, and diabetes, several transcriptomes of human respiratory, metabolic, and endocrine cells and tissue were analyzed.\n\n To estimate the association with COVID-19 severity, whole blood transcriptomes of critical patients with COVID-19 compared to those of hospitalized noncritical patients with COVID-19.\nResults\nWe found that SARS-CoV-2 infection impaired insulin/IGF signaling pathway genes, such as IRS, PI3K, AKT, mTOR, and MAPK, in the host lung, liver, adipose tissue, and pancreatic cells.\n\n The impairments were attributed to interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), and its gene expression was highly relevant to risk factors for severe COVID-19; increased with aging in the lung, specifically in men; augmented by obese and diabetic conditions in liver, adipose tissue, and pancreatic islets.\n\n IRF1 activation was significantly associated with the impaired insulin signaling in human cells.\n\n IRF1 intron variant rs17622656-A, which was previously reported to be associated with COVID-19 prevalence, increased the IRF1 gene expression in human tissue and was frequently found in American and European population.\n\n Critical patients with COVID-19 exhibited higher IRF1 and lower insulin/IGF signaling pathway genes in the whole blood compared to hospitalized noncritical patients.\n\n Hormonal interventions, such as dihydrotestosterone and dexamethasone, ameliorated the pathological traits in SARS-CoV-2 infectable cells and tissues.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe present study provides the first scientific evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs the insulin/IGF signaling pathway in respiratory, metabolic, and endocrine cells and tissues.\n\n This feature likely contributes to COVID-19 severity with cell/tissue damage and metabolic abnormalities, which may be exacerbated in older, male, obese, or diabetic patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9173833","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jihoon","surname":"Shin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shinichiro","surname":"Toyoda","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shigeki","surname":"Nishitani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Toshiharu","surname":"Onodera","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiro","surname":"Fukuda","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shunbun","surname":"Kita","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Atsunori","surname":"Fukuhara","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Iichiro","surname":"Shimomura","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.biopha.2022.113201","date":"2022-05-23","title":"Plasmatic renin-angiotensin system in normotensive and hypertensive patients hospitalized with COVID-19","abstract":"Background\nBesides its counterbalancing role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is the receptor for the type 2 coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, the etiological agent of COVID-19.

By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity.\n In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality.\n Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients.\n Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.\n Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7187729","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xinhui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotian","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020.

2019 (Covid-19) has not been well studied.\n\n\nMethods\nWe carried out a population-based case–control study in the Lombardy region of Italy.\n\n A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients’ clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAmong both case patients and controls, the mean (±SD) age was 68±13 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile.\n\n Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.86 to 1.05] for ARBs and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07] for ACE inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10] for ARBs and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21] for ACE inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this large, population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease.\n\n However, there was no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARBs affected the risk of

inhibitors might influence the severity of COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate whether continuing versus discontinuing renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) affects outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nMethods\nThe REPLACE COVID trial was a prospective, randomised, open-label trial done at 20 large referral hospitals in seven countries worldwide.\n\n Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor before admission.\n\n Individuals with contraindications to continuation or discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their renin–angiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system.\n\n The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan dysfunction during the hospitalisation.\n\n Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n The REPLACE COVID trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov,

(continuation group n=75; discontinuation group n=77).\n\n Mean age of participants was 62 years (SD 12), 68 (45%) were female, mean body-mass index was 33 kg/m2 (SD 8), and 79 (52%) had diabetes.\n\n Compared with discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, continuation had no effect on the global rank score (median rank 73 [IQR 40–110] for continuation vs 81 [38–117] for discontinuation; ?-coefficient 8 [95% CI ?13 to 29]).\n\n There were 16 (21%) of 75 participants in the continuation arm versus 14 (18%) of 77 in the discontinuation arm who required intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation, and 11 (15%) of 75 participants in the continuation group versus ten (13%) of 77 in the discontinuation group died.\n\n 29 (39%) participants in the

angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) mitigates the course o\f recent-onset COVID-19.\nMethods\nACEI-COVID was a parallel group, randomised, controlled, open-label trial done at 35 centres in Austria and Germany.\n\n Patients aged 18 years and older were enrolled if they presented with recent symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and were chronically treated with ACEIs or ARBs.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to discontinuation or continuation of RAS inhibition for 30 days.\n\n Primary outcome was the maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score within 30 days, where death was scored with the maximum achievable SOFA score.\n\n Secondary endpoints were area under the death-adjusted SOFA score (AUCSOFA), mean SOFA score, admission to the intensive care unit,

the occurrence of severe and fatal COVID?19 in infected hypertensive patients who were under treatment with angiotensin?converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) vs no treatment or other antihypertensives was conducted.\n\n\nMethods\nPubMed, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Library, medRxiv and bioRxiv were searched for relevant studies.\n\n Fixed?effects models or random?effects models were used depending on the heterogeneity between estimates.\n\n\nResults and discussion\nA total of eighteen studies with 17 311 patients were included.\n\n The use of RAS inhibitors was associated with a significant 16% decreased risk of the composite outcome (death, admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation requirement or progression to severe or critical pneumonia): RR: 0.84 (95% CI: 0.73?0.95), P = .\n\n007, I2 = 65%.\n\n\nWhat is new and conclusion\nThe results of this pooled analysis suggest that the use of ACEI/ARB does not worsen the prognosis of COVID?19, and could even be protective in hypertensive subjects.\n\n Hypertensive patients should continue these drugs even if they become infected with SARS?CoV?2.\n","id":"PMC7436708","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jessica","surname":"Barochiner","email":"jessica.barochiner@hospitalitaliano.org.ar","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rocío","surname":"Martínez","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rocío","surname":"Martínez","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.3594","date":"2021-02-07","title":"Association

angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) share a target receptor with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n The use of ACEIs/ARBs may cause angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor upregulation, facilitating the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells.\n There is concern that the use of ACEIs/ARBs could increase the risks of severe COVID-19 and mortality.\n The impact of discontinuing these drugs in patients with COVID-19 remains uncertain.\n We aimed to assess the association between the use of ACEIs/ARBs and the risks of mortality and severe disease in patients with COVID-19. A systematic search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and MedRxiv.\norg from December 1, 2019, to June 20, 2020. We also identified additional citations by manually searching the reference lists of eligible articles.\n Forty-two observational studies including 63,893 participants were included.\n We found that the use of ACEIs/ARBs was not significantly associated with a reduction in the relative risk of all-cause mortality [odds ratio (OR) = 0.87, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.75–1.00; I2 = 57%, p = 0.05].\n We found no significant reduction in the risk of severe disease in the ACEI subgroup (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.88–1.02, I2 = 50%, p = 0.18), the ARB subgroup (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.94–1.13, I2 = 62%, p = 0.48), or the ACEI/ARB subgroup (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.65–1.08, I2 = 67%, p = 0.16).\n Moreover, seven studies showed no significant difference in the duration of hospitalization between the two groups (mean difference = 0.33, 95% CI = ?1.75 to 2.40, p = 0.76).\n In conclusion, the use of ACEIs/ARBs appears to not have a significant effect on mortality, disease severity, or duration of hospitalization in COVID-19 patients.\n On the basis of the findings of this meta-analysis, there is no support for the cessation of treatment with ACEIs or ARBs in patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC8107232","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiao-Ce","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhuo-Yu","surname":"An","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zi-Yang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zi-Zhen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi-Ren","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3389/fmed.2021.703661","date":"2021-12-08","title":"Mortality

(ACEIs) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in COVID-19 disease susceptibility, severity, and treatment is unclear.\n\n\nPurpose:\nTo evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether use of ACEIs or ARBs either increases risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or is associated with worse COVID-19 disease outcomes, and to assess the efficacy of these medications for COVID-19 treatment.\n\n\nData Sources:\nMEDLINE (Ovid) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2003 to 4 May 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance for 1 year; the World Health

Extraction:\nSingle-reviewer abstraction confirmed by another reviewer, independent evaluation by 2 reviewers of study quality, and collective assessment of certainty of evidence.\n\n\nData Synthesis:\nTwo retrospective cohort studies found that ACEI and ARB use was not associated with a higher likelihood of receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, and 1 case–control study found no

COVID-19.\nLimitation:\nHalf the studies were small and did not adjust for important confounding variables.\n\n\nConclusion:\nHigh-certainty evidence suggests that ACEI or ARB use is not associated with more severe COVID-19 disease, and moderate-certainty evidence suggests no association between use of these medications and positive SARS-CoV-2 test results among symptomatic patients.\n\n Whether
