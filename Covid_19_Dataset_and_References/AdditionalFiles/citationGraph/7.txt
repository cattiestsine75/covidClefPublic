novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing

of the severity of coronavirus disease 2019: a model-based analysis","abstract":"Background\nIn the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude.\n\n We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020).\n\n These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital).\n\n We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment.\n\n We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China.\n\n Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio.\n\n Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.\n\n\nFindings\nUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1).\n\n In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70?117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80).\n\n However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ?60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged &lt;60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ?60 years [n=151]).\n\n Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age.\n\n Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–37·6) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThese early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Medical Research

Because it has only been studied for just over three months, our understanding of this disease is still incomplete, particularly regarding its sequelae and long-term outcomes.\n Moreover, very little has been written about the rehabilitation needs of patients with COVID-19 after discharge from acute care.\n The objective of this report is to answer the question “What rehabilitation services do survivors of COVID-19 require?” The question was asked within the context of a subacute hospital delivering geriatric inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services.\n\nThree areas relevant to rehabilitation after COVID-19 were identified.\n First, details of how patients may present have been summarized, including comorbidities, complications from an intensive care unit stay with or without intubation, and the effects of the virus on multiple body systems, including those pertaining to cardiac, neurological, cognitive, and mental health.\n Second, I have suggested procedures regarding the design of inpatient rehabilitation units for COVID-19 survivors, staffing issues, and considerations for outpatient rehabilitation.\n Third, guidelines for rehabilitation (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology) following COVID-19 have been proposed with respect to recovery of the respiratory system as well as recovery of mobility and function.\n \nA thorough assessment and an individualized, progressive treatment plan which focuses on function, disability, and return to participation in society will help each patient to maximize their function and quality of life.\n Careful consideration of the rehabilitation environment will ensure that all patients recover as completely as possible.\n","id":"PMC7212817","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Travis","surname":"Sanchez","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Meriam","surname":"Janssen","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Meriam","surname":"Janssen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edson","surname":"Da Silva","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lisa Mary","surname":"Sheehy","email":"lsheehy@bruyere.org","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Lisa Mary","surname":"Sheehy","email":"lsheehy@bruyere.org","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.medin.2020.04.002","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Pandemia por COVID-19: el mayor reto de la historia del intensivismo","abstract":"","id":"PMC7151426","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"R.","surname":"Ferrer","email":"r.ferrer@vhebron.net","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/bmj.m1106","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Covid-19: all non-urgent elective surgery is suspended for at least three months in England","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043828","date":"2020-10-23","title":"Estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer services and excess 1-year mortality in people with cancer and multimorbidity: near real-time data on cancer care, cancer deaths and a population-based cohort study","abstract":"Objectives\nTo estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care services and overall (direct and indirect) excess deaths in people with cancer.\n\n\nMethods\nWe employed near real-time weekly data on cancer care to determine the adverse effect of the pandemic on cancer services.\n\n We also used these data, together with national death registrations until June 2020 to model deaths, in excess of background (pre-COVID-19) mortality, in people with cancer.\n\n Background mortality risks for 24 cancers with and without COVID-19-relevant comorbidities were obtained from population-based primary care cohort (Clinical Practice Research Datalink) on 3?862?012 adults in England.\n\n\nResults\nDeclines in urgent referrals (median=?70.4%) and chemotherapy attendances (median=?41.5%) to a nadir (lowest point) in the pandemic were observed.\n\n By 31 May, these declines have only partially recovered;

patients who died and 6 (4%) who recovered, and lymphopenia was present in 103 (91%) and 76 (47%) respectively.\n\n Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients.\n\n Common complications observed more frequently in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 100%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart failure (41/83; 49%), alkalosis (14/35; 40%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37%), acute kidney injury (28; 25%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20%).\n\n Patients with cardiovascular comorbidity were more likely to develop cardiac complications.\n\n Regardless of history of cardiovascular disease, acute cardiac injury and heart failure were more common in deceased patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in patients at high risk.\n\n Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, and heart failure were the most common critical complications during exacerbation of covid-19.\n","id":"PMC7190011","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Di","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huilong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Weiming","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Danlei","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guang","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ke","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dong","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Haijing","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hongwu","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jia","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Ding","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaoping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiaquan","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Meifang","surname":"Han","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shusheng","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaoping","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jianping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qin","surname":"Ning","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.004","date":"2020-03-02","title":"Clinical

outbreak is a major threat to human beings.\n\n Previous studies mainly focused on Wuhan and typical symptoms.\n\n We analysed 74 confirmed COVID-19 cases with GI symptoms in the Zhejiang province to determine epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics.\n\n\nDesign\nCOVID-19 hospital patients were admitted in the Zhejiang province from 17 January 2020 to 8 February 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management and outcome data of patients with GI symptoms were analysed using multivariate analysis for risk of severe/critical type.\n\n Bioinformatics were used to analyse features of SARS-CoV-2 from Zhejiang province.\n\n\nResults\nAmong enrolled 651 patients, 74 (11.4%) presented with at least one GI symptom (nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea), average age of 46.14 years, 4-day incubation period and 10.8% had pre-existing liver disease.\n\n Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 17 (22.97%) and 23 (31.08%) had severe/critical types and family clustering, respectively, significantly higher than those without GI symptoms, 47 (8.14%) and 118 (20.45%).\n\n Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 29 (39.19%), 23 (31.08%), 8 (10.81%) and 16 (21.62%) had significantly higher rates of fever &gt;38.5°C, fatigue, shortness of breath and headache, respectively.\n\n Low-dose glucocorticoids and antibiotics were administered to 14.86% and 41.89% of patients, respectively.\n\n Sputum production and increased lactate dehydrogenase/glucose levels were risk factors for severe/critical type.\n\n Bioinformatics showed sequence mutation of SARS-CoV-2 with m6A methylation and changed binding capacity with ACE2.\nConclusion\nWe report COVID-19 cases with GI symptoms with novel features outside

a global pandemic disease, with more than 4 million cases and nearly 300,000 deaths.\n\n Little is known about COVID-19 in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\n We aimed to evaluate the influence of preexisting COPD on the progress and outcomes of COVID-19.\nMethods\nThis was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study.\n\n We enrolled 1,048 patients aged 40 years and above, including 50 patients with COPD and 998 patients without COPD, and with COVID-19 confirmed via high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, between December 11, 2019 and February 20, 2020. We collected data of demographics, pathologic test results, radiologic imaging, and treatments.\n\n The primary outcomes were composite endpoints determined by admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nCompared with patients who had COVID-19 but not COPD, those with COPD had higher rates of fatigue (56.0% vs.\n\n 40.2%), dyspnea (66.0% vs.\n\n

mortality have been identified; however, none has been validated in patients presenting with mild disease.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients with a diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia caused by SARS?CoV?2, presenting with mild symptoms, and requiring hospitalization in a non?intensive care unit with known discharge status were prospectively collected and retrospectively analysed.\n\n Demographical, clinical and biochemical parameters were recorded, as need for non?invasive mechanical ventilation and admission in intensive care unit.\n\n Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).\n\n Genomewide association analysis may allow for the identification of potential genetic factors involved in the development of Covid-19.\nMethods\nWe conducted a genomewide association study involving 1980 patients with Covid-19 and severe disease (defined as respiratory failure) at seven hospitals in the Italian and Spanish epicenters of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe.\n\n After quality control and the exclusion of population outliers, 835 patients and 1255 control participants from Italy and 775 patients and 950 control participants from Spain were included in the final analysis.\n\n In total, we analyzed 8,582,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and conducted a meta-analysis of the two case–control panels.\n\n\nResults\nWe detected cross-replicating associations with rs11385942 at locus 3p21.31 and with rs657152 at locus 9q34.2, which were significant at the genomewide level (P&lt;5×10?8) in the meta-analysis of the two case–control panels (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48 to 2.11; P=1.15×10?10; and odds ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.20 to

to high complication rates in patients with cardiometabolic diseases.\n\n Here, we identify risk factors and propose a clinical score to predict COVID-19 lethality, including specific factors for diabetes and obesity and its role in improving risk prediction.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe obtained data of confirmed and negative COVID-19 cases and their demographic and health characteristics from the General Directorate of Epidemiology of Mexican Ministry of Health.\n\n We investigated specific risk factors associated to COVID-19 positivity and mortality and explored the impact of diabetes and obesity on modifying COVID-19 related lethality.\n\n Finally, we built a clinical score to predict COVID-19 lethality.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong 177,133 subjects at May 18th, 2020, we observed 51,633 subjects with SARS-CoV-2 and 5,332 deaths.\n\n Risk factors for lethality in COVID-19 include early-onset diabetes, obesity, COPD, advanced age, hypertension, immunosuppression, and CKD; we observed that obesity mediates 49.5% of the effect of diabetes on COVID-19 lethality.\n\n Early-onset diabetes conferred an increased risk of hospitalization and obesity conferred an increased risk for ICU admission and intubation.\n\n Our predictive score for COVID-19 lethality included age ?65 years, diabetes, early-onset diabetes, obesity, age &lt;40 years, CKD, hypertension, and immunosuppression and significantly discriminates lethal from non-lethal COVID-19 cases (c-statistic=0.823).\n\n\nRESULTS\nHere, we propose a mechanistic approach to evaluate risk for complications and lethality attributable to COVID-19 considering the effect of obesity and diabetes in Mexico.\n\n Our score offers a clinical tool for quick determination of high-risk susceptibility patients in a first contact scenario.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7313944","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Omar

declared as a pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2).\n\n It spreads very rapidly and can result in severe acute respiratory failure.\n\n The clinical studies have shown that advanced age and chronic diseases increase the risk of infection.\n\n However, influence of the blood groups on COVID-19 infection and its outcome remains to be confirmed.\n\n The aim of this study is to investigate whether there exists a relationship between the blood groups of the patients and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.\n\n\nMaterial and method\n186 patients with PCR confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included in this study.\n\n Age, sex, blood groups, comorbidities, need for intubation and intensive care unit follow up and mortalities of the patients were analyzed retrospectively.\n\n 1881 healthy individuals, who presented to the Hacettepe University Blood Bank served as the controls.\n\n\nResults\n The most frequently detected blood group was blood group A (57%) amongst the COVID-19 patients.\n\n This was followed by blood group O (24.8%).\n\n The blood group types did not affect the clinical

models for diagnosis and prognosis of covid-19: systematic review and critical appraisal","abstract":"Objective\nTo review and critically appraise published and preprint reports of prediction models for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in patients with suspected infection, for prognosis of patients with covid-19, and for detecting people in the general population at increased risk of becoming infected with covid-19 or being admitted to hospital with the disease.\n\n\nDesign\nLiving systematic review and critical appraisal.\n\n\nData sources\nPubMed and Embase through Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 7 April 2020.\nStudy selection\nStudies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model.\n\n\nData extraction\nAt least two authors independently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool).\n\n\nResults\n4909 titles were screened, and 51 studies describing 66 prediction models were included.\n\n The review identified three models for predicting hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as proxy outcomes for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 47 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 (34 were based on medical imaging); and 16 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, or length of hospital stay.\n\n The most frequently reported predictors of presence of covid-19 included age, body temperature, signs and symptoms, sex, blood pressure, and creatinine.\n\n The most frequently reported predictors of severe prognosis in patients with covid-19 included age and features derived from computed tomography scans.\n\n C index estimates ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in prediction models for the general population, from 0.65 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models, and from 0.85 to 0.99 in prognostic models.\n\n All models were rated at high or unclear risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, high risk of model overfitting, and vague reporting.\n\n Most reports did not include any description of the study population or intended use of the models, and calibration of the model predictions was rarely assessed.\n\n\nConclusion\nPrediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed.\n\n This review indicates that proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic.\n\n Hence, we do not recommend any of these reported prediction models to be used in current practice.\n\n Immediate sharing of well documented individual participant data from covid-19 studies and collaboration are urgently needed to develop more rigorous prediction models, and validate promising ones.\n\n The predictors identified in included models should be considered as candidate predictors for new models.\n\n Methodological guidance should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions.\n\n Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.\n\n\nSystematic review registration\nProtocol

stratification of patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 using the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol: development and validation of the 4C Mortality Score","abstract":"Objective\nTo develop and validate a pragmatic risk score to predict mortality in patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19).\n\n\nDesign\nProspective observational cohort study.\n\n\nSetting\nInternational Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) study (performed by the ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium—ISARIC-4C) in 260 hospitals across England, Scotland, and Wales.\n\n Model training was performed on a cohort of patients recruited between 6 February and 20 May 2020, with validation conducted on a second cohort of patients recruited after model development between 21 May and 29 June 2020.\n\n\n\nParticipants\nAdults (age ?18 years) admitted to hospital with covid-19 at least four weeks before final data extraction.\n\n\nMain outcome measure\nIn-hospital mortality.\n\n\nResults\n35?463 patients were included in the derivation dataset (mortality rate 32.2%) and 22?361 in the validation dataset (mortality rate 30.1%).\n\n The final 4C Mortality Score included eight variables readily available at initial hospital assessment: age, sex, number of comorbidities, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, level of consciousness, urea level, and C reactive protein (score range 0-21 points).\n\n The 4C Score showed high discrimination for mortality (derivation cohort: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 0.79; validation cohort: 0.77, 0.76 to 0.77) with excellent calibration (validation: calibration-in-the-large=0, slope=1.0).\n\n Patients with a score of at least 15 (n=4158, 19%) had a 62% mortality (positive predictive value 62%) compared with 1% mortality for those with a score of 3 or less (n=1650, 7%; negative predictive value 99%).\n\n Discriminatory performance was higher than 15 pre-existing risk stratification scores (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve range 0.61-0.76), with scores developed in other covid-19 cohorts often performing poorly (range 0.63-0.73).\n\n\nConclusions\nAn easy-to-use risk stratification score has been developed and validated based on commonly available parameters at hospital presentation.\n\n The 4C Mortality Score outperformed existing scores, showed utility to directly inform clinical decision making, and can be used to stratify patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 into different management groups.\n\n The score should be further validated to determine its applicability in other populations.\n\n\nStudy registration\nISRCTN66726260\n","id":"PMC7116472","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Stephen

of the Clinical Frailty Scale in very elderly ICU patients: a prospective European study","abstract":"Purpose\nid='Par1'>Frailty is a valuable predictor for outcome in elderly ICU patients, and has been suggested to be used in various decision-making processes prior to and during an ICU admission.\n\n There are many instruments developed to assess frailty, but few of them can be used in emergency situations.\n\n In this setting the clinical frailty scale (CFS) is frequently used.\n\n The present study is a sub-study within a larger outcome study of elderly ICU patients in Europe (the VIP-2 study) in order to document the reliability of the CFS.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nid='Par2'>From the VIP-2 study, 129 ICUs in 20 countries participated in this sub-study.\n\n The patients were acute admissions???80 years of age and frailty was assessed at admission by two independent observers using the CFS.\n\n Information was obtained from the patient, if not feasible, from the family/caregivers or from hospital files.\n\n The profession of the rater and source of data were recorded along with the score.\n\n Interrater variability was calculated using linear weighted kappa analysis.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>1923 pairs of assessors were included and background data of patients were similar to the whole cohort (n?=?3920).\n\n We found a very high inter-rater agreement (weighted kappa 0.86), also in subgroup analyses.\n\n The agreement when comparing information from family or hospital records was better than using only direct patient information, and pairs of raters from same profession performed better than from different professions.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>Overall, we documented a high reliability using CFS in this setting.\n\n This frailty score could be used more frequently in elderly ICU patients in order to create a more holistic and realistic impression of the patient´s condition prior to ICU

survey","abstract":"Background\nAlthough tracheostomy is probably the most common surgical procedure performed on critically ill patients, it is unknown when a tracheostomy tube can be safely removed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a cross-sectional survey of physicians and respiratory therapists with expertise in the management of tracheostomized patients at 118 medical centers to characterize contemporary opinions about tracheostomy decannulation practice and to define factors that influence these practices.\n\n\nResults\nWe surveyed 309 clinicians, of whom 225 responded (73%).\n\n Clinicians rated patient level of consciousness, ability to tolerate tracheostomy tube capping, cough effectiveness, and secretions as the most important factors in the decision to decannulate a patient.\n\n Decannulation failure was defined as the need to reinsert an artificial airway within 48 hours (45% of respondents) to 96 hours (20% of respondents) of tracheostomy removal, and 2% to 5% was the most frequent recommendation for an acceptable recannulation rate (44% of respondents).\n\n In clinical scenarios, clinicians who worked in chronic care facilities (30%) were less likely to recommend decannulation than clinicians who worked in weaning (47%), rehabilitation (53%), or acute care (55%) facilities (p = 0.015).\n\n Patients were most likely to be recommended for decannulation if they were alert and interactive (odds ratio [OR] 4.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.27 to 6.90; p &lt; 0.001), had a strong cough (OR 3.84, 95% CI 2.66 to 5.54; p &lt; 0.001), had scant thin secretions (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.19; p &lt; 0.001), and required minimal supplemental oxygen (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.86; p &lt; 0.001).\n\n\nConclusion\nPatient level of consciousness, cough effectiveness, secretions, and oxygenation are important determinants of clinicians' tracheostomy decannulation opinions.\n\n Most surveyed clinicians defined decannulation failure as the need to reinsert an artificial airway within 48 to 96 hours of planned tracheostomy removal.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2374629","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Henry

ventilation","abstract":"Introduction\nPhysiological determinants of weaning success and failure are usually studied in ventilator-supported patients, comparing those who failed a trial of spontaneous breathing with those who tolerated such a trial and were successfully extubated.\n\n A major limitation of these studies was that the two groups may be not comparable concerning the severity of the underlying disease and the presence of comorbidities.\n\n In this physiological study, we assessed the determinants of weaning success in patients acting as their own control, once they are eventually liberated from the ventilator.\n\n\nMethods\nIn 30 stable tracheotomised ventilator-dependent patients admitted to a weaning center inside a respiratory intensive care unit, we recorded the breathing pattern, respiratory mechanics, inspiratory muscle function, and tension-time index of diaphragm (TTdi = Pdisw/Pdimax [that is, tidal transdiaphragmatic pressure over maximum transdiaphragmatic pressure] × Ti/Ttot [that is, the inspiratory time over the total breath duration]) at the time of weaning failure (T0).\n\n The measurements were repeated in all the patients (T1) either during a successful weaning trial (successful weaning [SW] group, n = 16) or 5 weeks later, in the case of repeated weaning failure (failed weaning [FW] group, n = 14).\n\n\nResults\nCompared to T0, in the FW group at T1, significant differences were observed only for a reduction in spontaneous breathing frequency and in TTdi (0.21 ± 0.122 versus 0.14 ± 0.054, P = 0.008).\n\n SW patients showed a significant increase in Pdimax (34.9 ± 18.9 cm H2O versus 43.0 ± 20.0, P = 0.02) and decrease in Pdisw/Pdimax (36.0% ± 15.8% versus 23.1% ± 7.9%, P = 0.004).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe recovery of an inadequate inspiratory muscle force could be the major determinant of 'late' weaning success, since this allows the patients to breathe far below the diaphragm fatigue threshold.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2717469","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Annalisa","surname":"Carlucci","email":"annalisa.carlucci@fsm.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Piero","surname":"Ceriana","email":"piero.ceriana@fsm.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Georgios","surname":"Prinianakis","email":"prin02@in.gr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Francesco","surname":"Fanfulla","email":"francesco.fanfulla@fsm.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Roberto","surname":"Colombo","email":"roberto.colombo@fsm.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stefano","surname":"Nava","email":"stefano.nava@fsm.it","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"T-Piece

reported on the use of high-flow oxygen via tracheostomy during weaning from ventilators in patients with restrictive pulmonary dysfunction.\n\n We report successful weaning from ventilators in patients with restrictive pulmonary dysfunction using high-flow oxygen via tracheostomy.\n\n\nCase presentation\nid='Par2'>The first patient is a 78-year-old Japanese man with severe pneumococcal pneumonia who was mechanically ventilated for more than 1 month after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.\n\n After he underwent tracheostomy because of prolonged mechanical ventilation, restrictive pulmonary dysfunction appeared: tidal volume 230–240 mL and static compliance 14–15 mL/cmH2O with 10 cmH2O pressure support ventilation.\n\n He was weaned from the ventilator under inspiratory support with high-flow oxygen via tracheostomy over a period of 16 days (flow at 40 L/minute and fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.25).\n\n The second patient is a 69-year-old Japanese man who developed aspiration pneumonia after esophagectomy and received prolonged mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy.\n\n He developed restrictive pulmonary dysfunction.\n\n High-flow oxygen via tracheostomy (flow at 40 L/minute with fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.25) was administered with measurement of the airway pressure and at the entrance of the tracheostomy tube.\n\n The measured values were as follows: 0.21–0.3 cmH2O, 0.21–0.56 cmH2O, 0.54–0.91 cmH2O, 0.76–2.01 cmH2O, 1.17–2.01 cmH2O, and 1.76–2.01 cmH2O at 10 L/minute, 20 L/minute, 30 L/minute, 40 L/minute, 50 L/minute, and 60 L/minute, respectively.\n\n The airway pressures were continuously positive and did not become negative even during inspiration, suggesting that high-flow oxygen via tracheostomy reduces inspiratory effort.\n\n He was weaned from the ventilator under inspiratory support with high-flow oxygen via tracheostomy over a period of 12 days.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par3'>High-flow oxygen via tracheostomy may reduce the inspiratory effort and enhance tidal volume by delivering high-flow oxygen and facilitate weaning from prolonged mechanical ventilation in patients with restrictive pulmonary

intensive care unit procedure, needs to be evaluated.\n\n\nObjectives:\nA prospective study conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital to find the late-onset speech and swallowing complications of tracheostomy in neurotrauma cases.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods:\nThis prospective observational study was conducted in the intensive care unit on intubated patients needing elective tracheostomy at a tertiary care teaching institute in South India with a dedicated referral trauma center.\n\n A data collection tool was prepared to find age, gender, date of admission, tracheostomy, and discharge, contact address and number, initial and final diagnosis, initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission and subsequent GCS before and after tracheostomy, ventilator settings before and after the tracheostomy, procedure and intraoperative complications, type of cannula used, details of decannulation, and respiratory difficulties.\n\n\nResults:\nIn our study among 69 cases between 16 and 75 years' age range with mean 46.67 ± 16.65, majority were males (75.36%) and 60 were cranial cases (86.96%).\n\n Of the alive cases (21 [30.43%]) who underwent tracheostomy; 18 were performed in operation theater and 3 as bedside procedure.\n\n Major problems reported were: Speech problems (not able to phonate) (9), feeble voice (6), pain while speaking (6), and reduced loudness (6), frequent throat clearing while speaking (4), cough while speaking (3); breathlessness while speaking (1), gasping while speaking (1) and vocal tiredness (1); aspirations (2) and painful swallowing (1).\n\n\nConclusions:\nOur study suggested that though, majority of neurotrauma patients require tracheostomy for long term ventilator support and associated speech and swallowing problems are expected.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6020642","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Valluri Anil","surname":"Kumar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bobba

Studies that reported a communication intervention with conscious nonverbal mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU aged 18 years or older were included.\n\n The methodological quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool.\n\n\nResults\nThe search yielded 9883 publications, of which 31 articles, representing 29 different studies, fulfilled the inclusion criteria.\n\n The overall methodological quality varied from poor to moderate.\n\n We identified four communication intervention types: (1) communication boards were studied in three studies—they improved communication and increased patient satisfaction, but they can be time-consuming and limit the ability to produce novel utterances; (2) two types of specialized talking tracheostomy tubes were assessed in eight studies—audible voicing was achieved in the majority of patients (range 74–100 %), but more studies are needed to facilitate safe and effective use; (3) an electrolarynx improved communication in seven studies—its effectiveness was mainly demonstrated with tracheostomized patients; and (4) “high-tech” augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices in nine studies with diverse computerized AAC devices proved to be beneficial communication methods—two studies investigated multiple AAC interventions, and different control devices (e.\n\ng.\n\n, touch-sensitive or eye/blink detection) can be used to ensure that physical limitations do not prevent use of the devices.\n\n We developed an algorithm for the assessment and selection of a communication intervention with nonverbal and conscious mechanically intubated patients in the ICU.\n\n\nConclusions\nAlthough evidence is limited, results suggest that most communication methods may be effective in improving patient–healthcare professional communication with mechanically ventilated patients.\n\n A combination of methods is advised.\n\n We developed an algorithm to standardize the approach for selection of communication techniques.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13054-016-1483-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5070186","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"S.","surname":"ten Hoorn","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"P.

impact of frailty on survival in elderly intensive care patients with COVID-19: the COVIP study","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>The COVID-19 pandemic has led highly developed healthcare systems to the brink of collapse due to the large numbers of patients being admitted into hospitals.\n\n One of the potential prognostic indicators in patients with COVID-19 is frailty.\n\n The degree of frailty could be used to assist both the triage into intensive care, and decisions regarding treatment limitations.\n\n Our study sought to determine the interaction of frailty and age in elderly COVID-19 ICU patients.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>A prospective multicentre study of COVID-19 patients ??70 years admitted to intensive care in 138 ICUs from 28 countries was conducted.\n\n The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality.\n\n Frailty was assessed using the clinical frailty scale.\n\n Additionally, comorbidities, management strategies and treatment limitations were recorded.\n\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>The study included 1346 patients (28% female) with a median age of 75 years (IQR 72–78, range 70–96), 16.3% were older than 80 years, and 21% of the patients were frail.\n\n The overall survival at 30 days was 59% (95% CI 56–62), with 66% (63–69) in fit, 53% (47–61) in vulnerable and 41% (35–47) in frail patients (p?&lt;?0.001).\n\n In frail patients, there was no difference in 30-day survival between different age categories.\n\n Frailty was linked to an increased use of treatment limitations and less use of mechanical ventilation.\n\n In a model controlling for age, disease severity, sex, treatment limitations and comorbidities, frailty was independently associated with lower survival.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>Frailty provides relevant prognostic information in elderly COVID-19 patients in addition to age and comorbidities.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at

from patients with an inferior clearance in terms of intensive care management and outcomes.\n This study analyzes a large collective with regards to baseline risk distribution and outcomes.\n Methods: In total, 3299 patients were included in this analysis, consisting of 1528 (46%) ?0% and 1771 (54%) &gt;0% patients.\n The primary endpoint was intensive care unit (ICU) mortality.\n Multilevel logistic regression analyses were used to compare both groups: A baseline model (model 1) with lactate clearance as a fixed effect and ICU as a random effect was installed.\n For model 2, patient characteristics (model 2) were included.\n For model 3, intensive care treatment (mechanical ventilation and vasopressors) was added to the model.\n Models 1 and 2 were used to evaluate the primary and secondary outcomes, respectively.\n Model 3 was only used to evaluate the primary outcomes.\n Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with respective 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.\n Results: The cohorts had no relevant differences regarding the gender, BMI, age, heart rate, body temperature, and baseline lactate.\n Neither the primary infection focuses nor the ethnic background differed between both groups.\n In both groups, the most common infection sites were of pulmonary origin, the urinary tract, and the gastrointestinal tract.\n Patients with lactate clearance &gt;0% evidenced lower sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores (7 ± 6 versus 9 ± 6; p &lt; 0.001) and creatinine (1.53 ± 1.49 versus 1.80 ± 1.67; p &lt; 0.001).\n The ICU mortality differed significantly (14% versus 32%), and remained this way after multivariable adjustment for patient characteristics and intensive care treatment (aOR 0.43 95% CI 0.36–0.53; p &lt; 0.001).\n In the additional sensitivity analysis, the lack of lactate clearance was associated with a worse prognosis in each subgroup.\n Conclusion: In this large collective of septic patients, the 6 h lactate clearance is an independent method for outcome prediction.\n","id":"PMC7767189","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Raphael

patients with sepsis.\n\n Recent studies suggest that lactate normalization during resuscitation is a more powerful indicator of resuscitative adequacy; however, early lactate clearance-guided therapy is still not recommended.\n\n We performed this meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of early lactate clearance-directed therapy as a potentially more effective resuscitation target.\n\n\nMethods:\nStudies were identified using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library without region, publication type, or language restrictions.\n\n Randomized trials were included when they compared the efficacy and safety of lactate clearance-guided resuscitation versus central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2)-guided therapy.\n\n The primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcomes were intensive care unit (ICU) stay, length of hospital stay, mechanical ventilation time, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II (APACHE-II) score, and Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.\n\n\nResults:\nSeven randomized controlled trials encompassing 1301 cases were reviewed.\n\n Compared with guided ScvO2 therapy, early lactate clearance-directed therapy was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality (relative ratio [RR] 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56 to 0.82), shorter ICU stay (mean difference [MD] ?1.64 days, 95% CI ?3.23 to ?0.05), shorter mechanical ventilation time (MD ?10.22?hours, 95% CI ?15.94 to ?4.5), and lower APACHE-II scores (MD ?4.47, 95% CI ?7.25 to ?1.69).\n\n However, patients undergoing early lactate clearance-guided therapy had similar lengths of hospital stay and similar SOFA scores.\n\n\nConclusions:\nAs a specific indicator of resuscitation outcome, lactate clearance alone is superior to ScvO2 alone during a standard resuscitation paradigm.\n\n The optimal or desired rate of lactate clearance is still a contentious area.\n\n To guide resuscitation and normalize lactate levels in patients, repeating lactate measurements every 2 hours until the patient has met a lactate clearance of 10% or greater may be helpful.\n\n\nTrial registration number:\nPROSPERO

Adverse Outcomes in Intensive Care Unit Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia: Preliminary Results from a GREEK Single-Centre Study","abstract":"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) continues to be a health threat worldwide.\n Increased blood lactate is common in intensive care unit (ICU) patients; however, its association with outcomes in ICU COVID-19 patients remains currently unexplored.\n In this retrospective, observational study we assessed whether lactate is associated with outcomes in COVID-19 patients.\n Blood lactate was measured on ICU admission and thereafter daily up to day 14 in 45 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) was calculated on ICU admission, and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was assessed on admission and every second day.\n The cohort was divided into survivors and non-survivors based on 28-day ICU mortality (24.4%).\n Cox regression analysis revealed that maximum lactate on admission was independently related to 28-day ICU mortality with time in the presence of APACHE II (RR = 2.45, p = 0.008).\n Lactate’s area under the curve for detecting 28-day ICU mortality was 0.77 (p = 0.008).\n Mixed model analysis showed that mean daily lactate levels were higher in non-survivors (p &lt; 0.0001); the model applied on SOFA scores showed a similar time pattern.\n Thus, initial blood lactate was an independent outcome predictor in COVID-19 ICU patients.\n The time course of lactate mirrors organ dysfunction and is associated with poor clinical outcomes.\n","id":"PMC7599563","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alice

impact of frailty on survival in elderly intensive care patients with COVID-19: the COVIP study","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>The COVID-19 pandemic has led highly developed healthcare systems to the brink of collapse due to the large numbers of patients being admitted into hospitals.\n\n One of the potential prognostic indicators in patients with COVID-19 is frailty.\n\n The degree of frailty could be used to assist both the triage into intensive care, and decisions regarding treatment limitations.\n\n Our study sought to determine the interaction of frailty and age in elderly COVID-19 ICU patients.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>A prospective multicentre study of COVID-19 patients ??70 years admitted to intensive care in 138 ICUs from 28 countries was conducted.\n\n The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality.\n\n Frailty was assessed using the clinical frailty scale.\n\n Additionally, comorbidities, management strategies and treatment limitations were recorded.\n\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>The study included 1346 patients (28% female) with a median age of 75 years (IQR 72–78, range 70–96), 16.3% were older than 80 years, and 21% of the patients were frail.\n\n The overall survival at 30 days was 59% (95% CI 56–62), with 66% (63–69) in fit, 53% (47–61) in vulnerable and 41% (35–47) in frail patients (p?&lt;?0.001).\n\n In frail patients, there was no difference in 30-day survival between different age categories.\n\n Frailty was linked to an increased use of treatment limitations and less use of mechanical ventilation.\n\n In a model controlling for age, disease severity, sex, treatment limitations and comorbidities, frailty was independently associated with lower survival.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>Frailty provides relevant prognostic information in elderly COVID-19 patients in addition to age and comorbidities.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at

surrounding them, yet there is little information available on indoor air quality and factors affecting it within a PICU.\n To address this gap in knowledge we conducted continuous indoor and outdoor airborne particle concentration measurements over a two-week period at the Royal Children's Hospital PICU in Brisbane, Australia, and we also collected 82 bioaerosol samples to test for the presence of bacterial and viral pathogens.\n Our results showed that both 24-hour average indoor particle mass (PM10) (0.6–2.2 ?g m? 3, median: 0.9 ?g m? 3) and submicrometer particle number (PN) (0.1–2.8 × 103 p cm? 3, median: 0.67 × 103 p cm? 3) concentrations were significantly lower (p &lt; 0.01) than the outdoor concentrations (6.7–10.2 ?g m? 3, median: 8.0 ?g m? 3 for PM10 and 12.1–22.2 × 103 p cm? 3, median: 16.4 × 103 p cm? 3 for PN).\n In general, we found that indoor particle concentrations in the PICU were mainly affected by indoor particle sources, with outdoor particles providing a negligible background.\n We identified strong indoor particle sources in the PICU, which occasionally increased indoor PN and PM10 concentrations from 0.1 × 103 to 100 × 103 p cm? 3, and from 2 ?g m? 3 to 70 ?g m? 3, respectively.\n The most substantial indoor particle sources were nebulization therapy, tracheal suction and cleaning activities.\n The average PM10 and PN emission rates of nebulization therapy ranged from 1.29 to 7.41 mg min? 1 and from 1.20 to 3.96 p min? 1 × 1011, respectively.\n Based on multipoint measurement data, it was found that particles generated at each location could be quickly transported to other locations, even when originating from isolated single-bed rooms.\n The most commonly isolated bacterial genera from both primary and broth cultures were skin commensals while viruses were rarely identified.\n Based on the findings from the study, we developed a set of practical recommendations for PICU design, as well

Influenza A H1N1 (2009)) is a significant concern for public health policy makers.\n\n World Health Organization (WHO)-defined ‘aerosol generating procedures’ (AGPs) are thought to increase the risk of aerosol transmission to HCWs, but there are presently insufficient data to quantify risk accurately or establish a hierarchy of risk-prone procedures.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nThis study measured the amount of H1N1 (2009) RNA in aerosols in the vicinity of H1N1 positive patients undergoing AGPs to help quantify the potential risk of transmission to HCWs.\n\n There were 99 sampling occasions (windows) producing a total of 198 May stages for analysis in the size ranges 0.86–7.3 µm.\n\n Considering stages 2 (4–7.3 µm) and 3 (0.86–4 µm) as comprising one sample, viral RNA was detected in 14 (14.1%) air samples from 10 (25.6%) patients.\n\n Twenty three air samples were collected while potential AGPs were being performed of which 6 (26.1%) contained viral RNA; in contrast, 76 May samples were collected when no WHO 2009 defined AGP was being performed of which 8 (10.5%) contained viral RNA (unadjusted OR?=?2.84 (95% CI 1.11–7.24) adjusted OR?=?4.31 (0.83–22.5)).\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nWith our small sample size we found that AGPs do not significantly increase the probability of sampling an H1N1 (2009) positive aerosol (OR (95% CI)?=?4.31 (0.83–22.5).\n\n Although the probability of detecting positive H1N1 (2009) positive aerosols when performing various AGPs on intensive care patients above the baseline rate (i.\n\ne.\n\n in the absence of AGPs) did not reach significance, there was a trend towards hierarchy of AGPs, placing bronchoscopy and respiratory and airway suctioning above baseline (background) values.\n\n Further, larger studies are required but these preliminary findings may be of benefit to infection control

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wei-jie","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-hua","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-quan","surname":"Ou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-xing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-liang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David S.C.","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lan-juan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guang","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ru-chong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-li","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ping-yan","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shi-yue","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin-lin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zi-jing","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yi-xiang","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ya-hua","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-ming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ji-yang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-jian","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shao-qin","surname":"Qiu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chang-jiang","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shao-yong","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nan-shan","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19: 11 March 2020.

Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5·2 and 7·4 log10 copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two-step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma.\n\n The 80-year-old patient died on day 14 of illness (Feb 14, 2020); all other patients had recovered and been discharged by Feb 19, 2020.\nInterpretation\nWe illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy.\n\n We believe that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.\n\n\nFunding\nREACTing (Research &amp; Action Emerging Infectious Diseases).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7156120","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Francois-Xavier","surname":"Lescure","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lila","surname":"Bouadma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Duc","surname":"Nguyen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marion","surname":"Parisey","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paul-Henri","surname":"Wicky","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sylvie","surname":"Behillil","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexandre","surname":"Gaymard","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maude","surname":"Bouscambert-Duchamp","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Flora","surname":"Donati","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Quentin","surname":"Le Hingrat","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vincent","surname":"Enouf","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nadhira","surname":"Houhou-Fidouh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Martine","surname":"Valette","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexandra","surname":"Mailles","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean-Christophe","surname":"Lucet","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"France","surname":"Mentre","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xavier","surname":"Duval","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Diane","surname":"Descamps","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Denis","surname":"Malvy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean-François","surname":"Timsit","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bruno","surname":"Lina","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sylvie","surname":"van-der-Werf","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yazdan","surname":"Yazdanpanah","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID-19: Guidance about Using Personal Protective Equipment.

Decannulation among those in whom weaning was successful (n?=?842) was achieved in 683 (81%) patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest cohort of COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy.\n\n The critical focus is the unprecedented amount of tracheostomies: 1890 in 7 weeks.\n\n Weaning could be achieved in over half of the patients with follow-up.\n\n

ventilation.\n\n Tracheostomy is not recommended by current guidelines as it is considered a superspreading event owing to aerosolization that unduly risks health care workers.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients with severe COVID-19 who were on mechanical ventilation for 5 days or longer were evaluated for percutaneous dilational tracheostomy.\n\n We developed a novel percutaneous tracheostomy technique that placed the bronchoscope alongside the endotracheal tube, not inside it.\n\n That improved visualization during the procedure and continued standard mechanical ventilation after positioning the inflated endotracheal tube cuff in the distal trachea.\n\n This technique offers a significant mitigation for the risk of virus aerosolization during the procedure.\n\n\nResults\nFrom March 10 to April 15, 2020, 270 patients with COVID-19 required invasive mechanical ventilation at New York University Langone Health Manhattan’s campus; of those, 98 patients underwent percutaneous dilational tracheostomy.\n\n The mean time from intubation to the procedure was 10.6 ± 5 days.\n\n Currently, 32 patients (33%) do not require mechanical ventilatory support, 19 (19%) have their tracheostomy tube downsized, and 8 (8%) were decannulated.\n\n Forty patients (41%) remain on full ventilator support, and 19 (19%) are weaning from mechanical ventilation.\n\n Seven patients (7%) died as a result of respiratory and multiorgan failure.\n\n Tracheostomy-related bleeding was the most common complication (5 patients).\n\n None of health care providers has had symptoms or tested positive for

strategy and optimal timing of tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19: Early experiences in Japan","abstract":"Objective\nTracheostomy is an important surgical procedure for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients who underwent prolonged tracheal intubation.\n\n Surgical indication of tracheostomy is greatly affected by the general condition of the patient, comorbidity, prognosis, hospital resources, and staff experience.\n\n Thus, the optimal timing of tracheostomy remains controversial.\n\n\nMethods\nWe reviewed our early experience with COVID-19 patients who underwent tracheostomy at one tertiary hospital in Japan from February to September 2020 and analyzed the timing of tracheostomy, operative results, and occupational infection in healthcare workers (HCWs).\n\n\nResults\nOf 16 patients received tracheal intubation with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, five patients (31%) received surgical tracheostomy in our hospital.\n\n The average consultation time for surgical tracheostomy was 7.4 days (range, 6 - 9 days) from the COVID-19 team to the otolaryngologist.\n\n The duration from tracheal intubation to tracheostomy ranged from 14 to 27 days (average, 20 days).\n\n The average time of tracheostomy was 27 min (range, 17 - 39 min), and post-wound bleeding occurred in only one patient.\n\n No significant differences in hemoglobin (Hb) levels were found between the pre- and postoperative periods (mean: 10.2 vs.\n\n 10.2 g/dl, p = 0.93).\n\n Similarly, no difference was found in white blood cell (WBC) count (mean: 12,200 vs.\n\n 9,900 cells /µl, p = 0.25).\n\n After the tracheostomy, there was no occupational infection among the HCWs who assisted the tracheostomy patients during the perioperative period.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe proposed a modified weaning protocol and surgical indications of tracheostomy for COVID-19 patients and recommend that an optimal timing for tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients of 2 - 3 weeks after tracheal intubation, from our early experiences in Japan.\n\n An experienced multi-disciplinary tracheostomy team is essential to perform a safe tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 and to minimize the risk of occupational infection in HCWs.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7674116","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Naoki","surname":"Nishio","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mariko","surname":"Hiramatsu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yukari","surname":"Goto","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuichiro","surname":"Shindo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Takanori","surname":"Yamamoto","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Naruhiro","surname":"Jingushi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Keiko","surname":"Wakahara","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michihiko","surname":"Sone","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.4187/respcare.08100","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Controversies

with a significant risk of viral contamination.\n Here, we describe our local approach for these procedures, introducing the “5Ts” of safe tracheostomy practice: Theatre set-up, Team Briefing, Transfer of patient, Tracheostomy Procedure, Team Doffing and De-brief.\n We identify the critical steps of the procedure and explain how we overcome the risks associated with breaking the transfer circuit to attach the patient to the theatre ventilator.\n We explain our technique to reduce secretion spillage when opening the trachea.\n We emphasise the importance of closed tracheal suctioning and mouth suctioning prior to patient transfer.\n We highlight the importance of maintaining a closed circuit throughout the procedure and describe tips on how to achieve this.\n We summarise the steps of our protocol in an “easy to reproduce” way.\n Finally, we emphasise the importance of communication in a constantly changing environment and challenging

anxiety, agitation and/or pain.\n\n Current opinion is that tracheotomy reduces sedation requirements.\n\n We determined sedation needs before and after tracheotomy of intubated and mechanically ventilated patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of the use of morphine, midazolam and propofol in patients before and after tracheotomy.\n\n\nResults\nOf 1,788 patients admitted to our intensive care unit during the study period, 129 (7%) were tracheotomized.\n\n After the exclusion of patients who received a tracheotomy before or at the day of admittance, 117 patients were left for analysis.\n\n The daily dose (DD; the amount of sedatives for each day) divided by the mean daily dose (MDD; the mean amount of sedatives per day for the study period) in the week before and the week after tracheotomy was 1.07 ± 0.93 DD/MDD versus 0.30 ± 0.65 for morphine, 0.84 ± 1.03 versus 0.11 ± 0.46 for midazolam, and 0.62 ± 1.05 versus 0.15 ± 0.45 for propofol (p &lt; 0.01).\n\n However, when we focused on a shorter time interval (two days before and after tracheotomy), there were no differences in prescribed doses of morphine and midazolam.\n\n Studying the course in DD/MDD from seven days before the placement of tracheotomy, we found a significant decline in dosage.\n\n From day -7 to day -1, morphine dosage (DD/MDD) declined by 3.34 (95% confidence interval -1.61 to -6.24), midazolam dosage by 2.95 (-1.49 to -5.29) and propofol dosage by 1.05 (-0.41 to -2.01).\n\n After tracheotomy, no further decrease in DD/MDD was observed and the dosage remained stable for all sedatives.\n\n Patients in the non-surgical and acute surgical groups received higher dosages of midazolam than patients in the elective surgical group.\n\n Time until tracheotomy did not influence sedation requirements.\n\n In addition, there was no significant difference in sedation between different patient groups.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn our intensive care unit, sedation requirements were not further reduced after tracheotomy.\n\n Sedation requirements were already sharply declining before tracheotomy was performed.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1751026","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Denise

timing for tracheotomy for critically ill COVID?19 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is not established.\n\n\nMethods\nMulticenter prospective cohort including all COVID?19 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) in 36 hospitals who required tracheotomy during first pandemic wave.\n\n With a target emulation trial framework, we studied the causal effects of early (7–10?days) versus late (&gt;10?days) tracheotomy (LT) on time from tracheotomy to weaning, postoperative mortality, and tracheotomy complications.\n\n\nResults\nOf 696 patients, 20.4% received early tracheotomy (ET).\n\n ET was associated with faster weaning (hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence interval, CI]: 1.25 [1.00–1.56]) without differences in mortality (HR [95% CI]: 0.85 [0.60–1.21]) or complications (adjusted rate ratio [95% CI]: 0.56 [0.23–1.33]).\n\n\nConclusions\nET had a similar or lower post?tracheotomy weaning time than LT, potentially shortening IMV and ICU stays, without

Comparisons between the viruses were made.\n\n\nResults\nInadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries.\n\n Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic.\n\n Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport.\n\n The availability of connecting

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas.\n\n Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.\n\n\nMethods\nWe combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas.\n\n To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan.\n\n The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.\nFindings\nWe estimated that the median daily reproduction number (Rt) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·15–4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41–2·39) 1 week after.\n\n Based on our estimates of Rt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures.\n\n As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and National Institute for Health Research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158569","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Adam J","surname":"Kucharski","email":"adam.kucharski@lshtm.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Timothy W","surname":"Russell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Charlie","surname":"Diamond","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"John","surname":"Edmunds","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sebastian","surname":"Funk","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rosalind M","surname":"Eggo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fiona","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Jit","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"James D","surname":"Munday","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nicholas","surname":"Davies","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Amy","surname":"Gimma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kevin","surname":"van Zandvoort","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hamish","surname":"Gibbs","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joel","surname":"Hellewell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christopher I","surname":"Jarvis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sam","surname":"Clifford","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Billy J","surname":"Quilty","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nikos I","surname":"Bosse","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sam","surname":"Abbott","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Petra","surname":"Klepac","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stefan","surname":"Flasche","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Tracheostomy: epidemiology, indications, timing, technique, and outcomes","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1093/bja/aeh568","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Tracheostomy in a patient with SARS","abstract":"","id":"PMC7110094","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"P.","surname":"Morgan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/bja/aeh035","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Tracheostomy in a patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome","abstract":"The coronavirus which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a virulent and highly contagious organism.\n Of the 1755 SARS patients in Hong Kong, over 400 were healthcare workers.\n Meticulous attention to infection control and teamwork are essential to minimize cross?contamination and prevent staff from contracting the illness.\n These points are especially pertinent when anaesthetizing SARS patients for high?risk procedures such as tracheostomy.\n We describe the management of such a case.\n","id":"PMC7094700","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"A.","surname":"Kwan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"W.

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients

with COVID-19, the median age was 55.0 years and 48.9% were male and only 8 (3.6%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market.\n\n Compared to the non-severe pneumonia patients, the median age of the severe patients was significantly older, and they were more likely to have chronic comorbidities.\n\n Most common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea.\n\n On admission, 33.0% patients showed leukopenia and 73.8% showed lymphopenia.\n\n In addition, the severe patients suffered a higher rate of co-infections with bacteria or fungus and they were more likely to developing complications.\n\n As of February 15, 2020, 19.0% patients had been discharged and 5.4% patients died.\n\n 80% of severe cases received ICU (intensive care unit) care, and 52.3% of them transferred to the general wards due to relieved symptoms, and the mortality rate of severe patients in ICU was 20.5%.\n\n\nConclusions\nPatients with elder age, chronic comorbidities, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count, procalcitonin level, co-infection and severe complications might increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7194884","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Guqin","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chang","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linjie","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fang","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongfeng","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianguo","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiyong","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqin","surname":"Pan","email":"phq2012@whu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"10.1097/SLA.0000000000003956","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Tracheotomy

enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients

outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), consistent and considerable differences in disease severity and mortality rate of patients treated in Hubei province compared to those in other parts of China have been observed.\n\n We sought to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients being treated inside and outside Hubei province, and explore the factors underlying these differences.\n\n\nMethods\nCollaborating with the National Health Commission, we established a retrospective cohort to study hospitalised COVID-19 cases in China.\n\n Clinical characteristics, the rate of severe events and deaths, and the time to critical illness (invasive ventilation or intensive care unit admission or death) were compared between patients within and outside Hubei.\n\n The impact of Wuhan-related exposure (a presumed key factor that drove the severe situation in Hubei, as Wuhan is the epicentre as well the administrative centre of Hubei province) and the duration between symptom onset and admission on prognosis were also determined.\n\n\nResults\nAt the data cut-off (31 January 2020), 1590 cases from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions were collected (core cohort).\n\n The overall rate of severe cases and mortality was 16.0% and 3.2%, respectively.\n\n Patients in Hubei (predominantly with Wuhan-related exposure, 597 (92.3%) out of 647) were older (mean age 49.7 versus 44.9?years), had more cases with comorbidity (32.9% versus 19.7%), higher symptomatic burden, abnormal radiologic manifestations and, especially, a longer waiting time between symptom onset and admission (5.7 versus 4.5?days) compared with patients outside Hubei.\n\n Patients in Hubei (severe event rate 23.0% versus 11.1%, death rate 7.3% versus 0.3%, HR (95% CI) for critical illness 1.59 (1.05–2.41)) have a poorer prognosis compared with patients outside Hubei after adjusting for age and comorbidity.\n\n However, among patients outside Hubei, the duration from symptom onset to hospitalisation (mean 4.4 versus 4.7?days) and prognosis (HR (95%) 0.84 (0.40–1.80)) were similar between patients with or without Wuhan-related exposure.\n\n In the overall population, the waiting time, but neither treated in Hubei nor Wuhan-related exposure, remained an independent prognostic factor (HR (95%) 1.05 (1.01–1.08)).\n\n\nConclusion\nThere were more severe cases and poorer outcomes for COVID-19 patients treated in Hubei, which might be attributed to the prolonged duration of symptom onset to hospitalisation in the epicentre.\n\n Future studies to determine the reason for delaying hospitalisation are warranted.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7144336","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wen-hua","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei-jie","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cai-chen","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi-min","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Heng-rui","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-qing","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ling","surname":"Sang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ru-chong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-li","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-hua","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zi-sheng","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sook-San","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Zanin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jian-fu","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li-min","surname":"Ou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shan","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhan-hong","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-liang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi-xiang","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ya-hua","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-ming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ji-yang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-jian","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shao-qin","surname":"Qiu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chang-jiang","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shao-yong","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-ling","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Feng","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shi-yue","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin-ping","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nuo-fu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nan-shan","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-xing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30230-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Tracheostomy

national cohort study in Spain","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>The question of an optimal strategy and outcomes in COVID-19 tracheostomy has not been answered yet.\n\n The critical focus in our case study is to evaluate the outcomes of tracheostomy on intubated COVID-19 patients.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>A multicentric prospective observational study of 1890 COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy across 120 hospitals was conducted over 7 weeks in Spain (March 28 to May 15, 2020).\n\n Data were collected with an innovative approach: instant messaging via WhatsApp.\n\n Outcome measurements: complications, achieved weaning and decannulation and survival.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>We performed 1,461 surgical (81.3%) and 429 percutaneous tracheostomies.\n\n Median timing of tracheostomy was 12 days (4–42 days) since orotracheal intubation.\n\n A close follow-up of 1616/1890 (85.5%) patients at the cut-off time of 1-month follow-up showed that in 842 (52.1%) patients, weaning was achieved, while 391 (24.2%) were still under mechanical ventilation and 383 (23.7%) patients had died from COVID-19. Decannulation among those in whom weaning was successful (n?=?842) was achieved in 683 (81%) patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest cohort of COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy.\n\n The critical focus is the unprecedented amount of tracheostomies: 1890 in 7 weeks.\n\n Weaning could be achieved in over half of the patients with follow-up.\n\n Almost one out of four tracheotomized patients died from

meta-analysis","abstract":"Introduction\nThe aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis to determine whether percutaneous tracheostomy (PT) techniques are advantageous over surgical tracheostomy (ST), and if one PT technique is superior to the others.\n\n\nMethods\nComputerized databases (1966 to 2013) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting complications as predefined endpoints and comparing PT and ST and among the different PT techniques in mechanically ventilated adult critically ill patients.\n\n Odds ratios (OR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI), and I2 values were estimated.\n\n\nResults\nFourteen RCTs tested PT techniques versus ST in 973 patients.\n\n PT techniques were performed faster (MD, ?13.06 minutes (95% CI, ?19.37 to ?6.76 (P &lt;0.0001)); I2?=?97% (P &lt;0.00001)) and reduced odds for stoma inflammation (OR, 0.38 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.76 (P?=?0.006)); I2?=?2% (P?=?0.36)), and infection (OR, 0.22 (95% CI, 0.11 to

the rate of transmission of COVID-19 to health care workers.\n\n Otolaryngology groups are recommending a higher level of personal protective equipment for aerosol-generating procedures than public health agencies.\n\n The objective of the review was to provide evidence that a.\n\n) demonstrates which otolaryngology procedures are aerosol-generating, and that b.\n\n) clarifies whether the higher level of PPE advocated by otolaryngology groups is justified.\n\n\nMain body\nid='Par2'>Health care workers in China who performed tracheotomy during the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic had 4.15 times greater odds of contracting the virus than controls who did not perform tracheotomy (95% CI 2.75–7.54).\n\n No other studies provide direct epidemiological evidence of increased aerosolized transmission of viruses during otolaryngology procedures.\n\n Experimental evidence has shown that electrocautery, advanced energy devices, open suctioning, and drilling can create aerosolized biological particles.\n\n The viral load of COVID-19 is highest in the upper aerodigestive tract, increasing the likelihood that aerosols generated during procedures of the upper aerodigestive tract of infected patients would carry viral material.\n\n Cough and normal breathing create aerosols which may increase the risk of transmission during outpatient procedures.\n\n A significant proportion of individuals infected with COVID-19 may not have symptoms, raising the likelihood of transmission of the disease to inadequately protected health care workers from patients who do not have probable or confirmed infection.\n\n Powered air purifying respirators, if used properly, provide a greater level of filtration than N95 masks and thus may reduce the risk of transmission.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par3'>Direct and indirect evidence suggests that a large number of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery procedures are aerosol generating.\n\n Otolaryngologists are likely at high risk of contracting COVID-19 during aerosol generating procedures because they are likely exposed to high viral loads in patients infected with the virus.\n\n Based on the precautionary principle, even though the evidence is not definitive, adopting enhanced personal protective equipment protocols is reasonable based on the evidence.\n\n Further research is needed to clarify the risk associated with performing various procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the degree to which various personal protective equipment reduces the

prolonged intubation for mechanical ventilation to support breathing; thus, the artificial airway must be managed by tracheotomy.\n\n Therefore, studies exploring appropriate and safe methods for tracheotomy that minimize the risks of nosocomial transmission are important.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA retrospective analysis of the clinical characteristics of 14 critically ill patients with COVID-19, who underwent bedside tracheotomy from March to April 2020 was conducted to summarize the indications for tracheotomy and key points related to personal protective equipment and surgical procedures.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll 14 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 and were critically ill.\n\n All tracheotomies were performed in the late phase of the infection course.\n\n The interval between the infection and tracheotomy was 33?days, and the median interval between intubation and tracheotomy was 25.5?days.\n\n The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results of secretions from

a high likelihood of needing prolonged intubation and may subsequently require tracheotomy.\n\n Usually, the choice of technique (percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy [PDT] versus open surgical tracheotomy [OST]) depends on the preference of surgeons and patient-related factors.\n\n In case of COVID-19, airborne spread of viral particles and limited time of apnea must be considered in the choice of the safest technique.\n\n The aim of this study is to compare the complication rates and offer an assessment of relative risks and benefits of PDT versus OST in patients with severe

multidisciplinary guidance","abstract":"Global health care is experiencing an unprecedented surge in the number of critically ill patients who require mechanical ventilation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n The requirement for relatively long periods of ventilation in those who survive means that many are considered for tracheostomy to free patients from ventilatory support and maximise scarce resources.\n COVID-19 provides unique challenges for tracheostomy care: health-care workers need to safely undertake tracheostomy procedures and manage patients afterwards, minimising risks of nosocomial transmission and compromises in the quality of care.\n Conflicting recommendations exist about case selection, the timing and performance of tracheostomy, and the subsequent management of patients.\n In response, we convened an international working group of individuals with relevant expertise in tracheostomy.\n We did a literature and internet search for reports of research pertaining to tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic, supplemented by sources comprising statements and guidance on tracheostomy care.\n By synthesising early experiences from countries that have managed a surge in patient numbers, emerging virological data, and international, multidisciplinary expert opinion, we aim to provide consensus guidelines and recommendations on the conduct and management of tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n","id":"PMC7228735","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Brendan

to worldwide, which has attracted many people's concerns about the patients.\n However, studies on the infection status of medical personnel is still lacking.\n A total of 54 cases of SARS?Cov?2 infected medical staff from Tongji Hospital between 7 January and 11 February 2020 were analyzed in this retrospective study.\n Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were compared between different groups by statistical method.\n From 7 January to 11 February 2020, 54 medical staff of Tongji Hospital were hospitalized due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19).\n Most of them were from other clinical departments (72.2%) rather than emergency department (3.7%) or medical technology departments (18.5%).\n Among the 54 patients with COVID?19, the distribution of age had a significant difference between non?severe type and severe/critical cases (median age: 47 years vs 38 years; P?=?.\n0015).\n However, there was no statistical difference in terms of gender distribution and the first symptoms between theses two groups.\n Furthermore, we observed that the lesion regions in SARS?Cov?2 infected lungs with severe?/critical?type of medical staff were more likely to exhibit lesions in the right upper lobe (31.7% vs 0%; P?=?.\n028) and right lung (61% vs 18.2%; P?=?.\n012).\n Based on our findings with medical staff infection data, we suggest training for all hospital

responses to SARS-CoV-2 in patients of novel coronavirus disease 2019","abstract":"Background\nThe novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging virus.\n\n The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 173 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled.\n\n Their serial plasma samples (n=535) collected during the hospitalization were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of antibodies with the disease progress was analyzed.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1%, 82.7% and 64.7%, respectively.\n\n The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness.\n\n The median seroconversion time for Ab, IgM and then IgG were day-11, day-12 and day-14, separately.\n\n The presence of antibodies was &lt;40% among patients within 1-week since onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0% (Ab), 94.3% (IgM) and 79.8% (IgG) since day-15 after onset.\n\n In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day-7 to 45.5% (25/55) during day 15-39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (p&lt;0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p=0.007).\n\n Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p=0.006).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19

During the next two months, it moved rapidly throughout China.\n Most of the infected patients have mild symptoms including fever, fatigue and cough, but in severe cases, patients can progress rapidly and develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.\n The new coronavirus was reported to spread via droplets, contact and natural aerosols from human to human.\n Therefore, aerosol-producing procedures such as endotracheal intubation may put the anesthesiologists at high risk of nosocomial infections.\n In fact, SARS-CoV-2 infection of anesthesiologists after endotracheal intubation for confirmed COVID-19 patients have been reported in hospitals in Wuhan.\n The expert panel of airway management in Chinese Society of Anaesthesiology has deliberated and drafted this recommendation, by which we hope to guide the performance of endotracheal intubation by frontline anesthesiologists and critical care physicians.\n During the airway management, enhanced droplet/airborne personal protective equitment (PPE) should be applied to the health care providers.\n A good airway assessment before airway intervention is of vital importance.\n For patients with normal airway, awake intubation should be avoided, and modified rapid sequence induction is strongly recommended.\n Sufficient muscle relaxant should be assured before intubation.\n For patients with difficult airway, good preparation of airway devices and detailed intubation plans should be made.\n","id":"PMC7367670","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mingzhang","surname":"Zuo","email":"zuomz@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuguang","surname":"Huang","email":"garybeijing@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wuhua","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhanggang","surname":"Xue","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiaqiang","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yahong","surname":"Gong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Che","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamaoto.2020.0488","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Practical

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

and local residual draws","abstract":"Background\nMultiple imputation is a commonly used method for handling incomplete covariates as it can provide valid inference when data are missing at random.\n\n This depends on being able to correctly specify the parametric model used to impute missing values, which may be difficult in many realistic settings.\n\n Imputation by predictive mean matching (PMM) borrows an observed value from a donor with a similar predictive mean; imputation by local residual draws (LRD) instead borrows the donor’s residual.\n\n Both methods relax some assumptions of parametric imputation, promising greater robustness when the imputation model is misspecified.\n\n\nMethods\nWe review development of PMM and LRD and outline the various forms available, and aim to clarify some choices about how and when they should be used.\n\n We compare performance to fully parametric imputation in simulation studies, first when the imputation model is correctly specified and then when it is misspecified.\n\n\nResults\nIn using PMM or LRD we strongly caution against using a single donor, the default value in some implementations, and instead advocate sampling from a pool of around 10 donors.\n\n We also clarify which matching metric is best.\n\n Among the current MI software there are several poor implementations.\n\n\nConclusions\nPMM and LRD may have a role for imputing covariates (i) which are not strongly associated with outcome, and (ii) when the imputation model is thought to be slightly but not grossly misspecified.\n\n Researchers should spend efforts on specifying the imputation model correctly, rather than expecting predictive mean matching or local residual draws to do the work.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4051964","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tim

interactions: an evaluation of statistical methods","abstract":"Background\nMultiple imputation is often used for missing data.\n\n When a model contains as covariates more than one function of a variable, it is not obvious how best to impute missing values in these covariates.\n\n Consider a regression with outcome Y and covariates X and X2.\n\n In 'passive imputation' a value X* is imputed for X and then X2 is imputed as (X*)2.\n\n A recent proposal is to treat X2 as 'just another variable' (JAV) and impute X and X2 under multivariate normality.\n\n\nMethods\nWe use simulation to investigate the performance of three methods that can easily be implemented in standard software: 1) linear regression of X on Y to impute X then passive imputation of X2; 2) the same regression but with predictive mean matching (PMM); and 3) JAV.\n\n We also investigate the performance of analogous methods when the analysis involves an interaction, and study the theoretical properties of JAV.\n\n The application of the methods when complete or incomplete confounders are also present is illustrated using data from the EPIC Study.\n\n\nResults\nJAV gives consistent estimation when the analysis is linear regression with a quadratic or interaction term and X is missing completely at random.\n\n When X is missing at random, JAV may be biased, but this bias is generally less than for passive imputation and PMM.\n\n Coverage for JAV was usually good when bias was small.\n\n However, in some scenarios with a more pronounced quadratic effect, bias was large and coverage poor.\n\n When the analysis was logistic regression, JAV's performance was sometimes very poor.\n\n PMM generally improved on passive imputation, in terms of bias and coverage, but did not eliminate the bias.\n\n\nConclusions\nGiven the current state of available software, JAV is the best of a set of imperfect imputation methods for linear regression with a quadratic or interaction effect, but should not be used for logistic regression.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3403931","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Shaun

for an incomplete covariate that is a ratio","abstract":"We are concerned with multiple imputation of the ratio of two variables, which is to be used as a covariate in a regression analysis.\n If the numerator and denominator are not missing simultaneously, it seems sensible to make use of the observed variable in the imputation model.\n One such strategy is to impute missing values for the numerator and denominator, or the log-transformed numerator and denominator, and then calculate the ratio of interest; we call this ‘passive’ imputation.\n Alternatively, missing ratio values might be imputed directly, with or without the numerator and/or the denominator in the imputation model; we call this ‘active’ imputation.\n In two motivating datasets, one involving body mass index as a covariate and the other involving the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, we assess the sensitivity of results to the choice of imputation model and, as an alternative, explore fully Bayesian joint models for the outcome and incomplete ratio.\n Fully Bayesian approaches using Winbugs were unusable in both datasets because of computational problems.\n In our first dataset, multiple imputation results are similar regardless of the imputation model; in the second, results are sensitive to the choice of imputation model.\n Sensitivity depends strongly on the coefficient of variation of the ratio's denominator.\n A simulation study demonstrates that passive imputation without transformation is risky because it can lead to downward bias when the coefficient of variation of the ratio's denominator is larger than about 0.1. Active imputation or passive imputation after log-transformation is preferable.\n © 2013 The Authors.\n Statistics in Medicine published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.\n","id":"PMC3920636","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tim P","surname":"Morris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ian R","surname":"White","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Royston","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shaun R","surname":"Seaman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Angela M","surname":"Wood","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0895-4356(02)00539-5","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Developing a prognostic model in the presence of missing data","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Regression models and life tables","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1002/sim.3618","date":"2009-04-02","title":"Imputing missing covariate values for the Cox model","abstract":"Multiple imputation is commonly used to impute missing data, and is typically more efficient than complete cases analysis in regression analysis when covariates have missing values.\n Imputation may be performed using a regression model for the incomplete covariates on other covariates and, importantly, on the outcome.\n With a survival outcome, it is a common practice to use the event indicator D and the log of the observed event or censoring time T in the imputation model, but the rationale is not clear.\n","id":"PMC2998703","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ian R","surname":"White","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Royston","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jeconom.2011.02.005","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Regression with imputed covariates: A generalized missing-indicator approach","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1177/0049124113502943","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Multiple imputation of squared terms","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement: guidelines for reporting observational studies","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Safety of bedside surgical tracheostomy during COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective observational study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References":[{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020.

procedures.\n\n\nBackground:\nTracheostomy is often performed for prolonged endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients.\n\n However, in the context of COVID-19, tracheostomy placement pathways have been altered due to the poor prognosis of intubated patients and the risk of transmission to providers through this highly aerosolizing procedure.\n\n\nMethods:\nA prospective single-system multi-center observational cohort study was performed on patients who underwent tracheostomy after acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19.\nResults:\nOf the 53 patients who underwent tracheostomy, the average time from endotracheal intubation to tracheostomy was 19.7 days?±?6.9 days.\n\n The most common indication for tracheostomy was acute respiratory distress syndrome, followed by failure to wean ventilation and post-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation decannulation.\n\n Thirty patients (56.6%) were liberated from the ventilator, 16 (30.2%) have been discharged alive, 7 (13.2%) have been decannulated, and 6 (11.3%) died.\n\n The average time from tracheostomy to ventilator liberation was 11.8 days?±?6.9 days (range 2–32 days).\n\n Both open surgical and percutaneous dilational tracheostomy techniques were performed utilizing methods to mitigate aerosols.\n\n No healthcare worker transmissions resulted from performing the procedure.\n\n\nConclusions:\nAlterations to tracheostomy practices and processes were successfully instituted.\n\n Following these steps, tracheostomy in COVID-19 intubated patients seems safe for both patients and healthcare workers

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

registry data, supplemented by an ICU surge capability survey and veterinary facilities survey (both March 2020).\n\n\nSettings\nAll Australian ICUs and veterinary facilities.\n\n\nMain outcome measures\nBaseline numbers of ICU beds, ventilators, dialysis machines, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines, intravenous infusion pumps, and staff (senior medical staff, registered nurses); incremental capability to increase capacity (surge) by increasing ICU bed numbers; ventilator?to?bed ratios; number of ventilators in veterinary facilities.\n\n\nResults\nThe 191 ICUs in Australia provide 2378 intensive care beds during baseline activity (9.3 ICU beds per 100 000 population).\n\n Of the 175 ICUs that responded to the surge survey (with 2228 intensive care beds), a maximal surge would add an additional 4258 intensive care beds (191% increase) and 2631 invasive ventilators (120% increase).\n\n This surge would require additional staffing of as many as 4092 senior doctors (245%

ventilators.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe directors of Australian ICUs report that intensive care bed capacity could be near tripled in response to the expected increase in demand caused by COVID?19. But maximal surge in bed numbers could be hampered by a shortfall in invasive ventilators and would also require a large increase in clinician and nursing staff numbers.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7264562","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Edward","surname":"Litton","email":"ed.litton@health.wa.gov.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tamara","surname":"Bucci","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shaila","surname":"Chavan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yvonne Y","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anthony","surname":"Holley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gretta","surname":"Howard","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sue","surname":"Huckson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Philomena","surname":"Kwong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Johnny","surname":"Millar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nhi","surname":"Nguyen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Secombe","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Ziegenfuss","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Pilcher","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1503/cmaj.200457","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Projecting demand for critical care beds during COVID-19 outbreaks in Canada","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Anandaciva S (2020) Critical care services in the English NHS.

quantitative semiquantitative clinical score","abstract":"Background\nTracheostomy is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in critical care patient management; more specifically, ventilation through tracheal cannula allows removal of the endotracheal tube (ETT).\n\n Available literature about tracheostomy care and decannulation is mainly represented by expert opinions and no certain knowledge arises from it.\n\n\nMethods\nIn lack of statistical requirements, a systematic and critical review of literature regarding tracheostomy tube removal was performed in order to assess predictor factors of successful decannulation and to propose a predictive score.\n\n We combined 3 terms and a literature search has been performed using the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE via Ovid SP; EMBASE via Ovid SP; EBSCO.\n\n Abstracts were independently reviewed: for those studies fitting the inclusion criteria on the basis of the title and abstract, full-text was achieved.\n\n We included studies published from January 1, 1995 until March 31, 2014; any sort of review and expert opinion has been excluded by our survey.\n\n English language restriction was applied.\n\n Ten studies have been considered eligible for inclusion in the review and were analysed further.\n\n\nResults\nCough effectiveness and ability to tolerate tracheostomy tube capping are the most considered parameters in clinical practice; other parameters are taken into different consideration by many authors in order to proceed to decannulation.\n\n Among them, we distinguished between objective quantitative parameters and semi-quantitative parameters more dependent from clinician’s opinion.\n\n We then built a score (the Quantitative semi Quantitative score: QsQ score) based on selected parameters coming from literature.\n\n\nConclusions\nOn our knowledge, this review provides the first proposal of decannulation score system based on current literature that is hypothetical and requires to be validated in daily practice.\n\n The key point of our proposal is to give a higher value to the objective parameters coming from literature compared to less quantifiable clinical ones.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4277832","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Pierachille","surname":"Santus","email":"pierachille.santus@unimi.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andrea","surname":"Gramegna","email":"gramegna.med@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dejan","surname":"Radovanovic","email":"danko86@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rita","surname":"Raccanelli","email":"rita.raccanelli@fsm.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vincenzo","surname":"Valenti","email":"vincenzo.valenti@unimi.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dimitri","surname":"Rabbiosi","email":"dimitri.rabbiosi@ao-sanpaolo.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michele","surname":"Vitacca","email":"michele.vitacca@fsm.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stefano","surname":"Nava","email":"stefano.nava@unibo.it","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.037","date":"2020-03-24","title":"The

current guidelines as it is considered a superspreading event owing to aerosolization that unduly risks health care workers.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients with severe COVID-19 who were on mechanical ventilation for 5 days or longer were evaluated for percutaneous dilational tracheostomy.\n\n We developed a novel percutaneous tracheostomy technique that placed the bronchoscope alongside the endotracheal tube, not inside it.\n\n That improved visualization during the procedure and continued standard mechanical ventilation after positioning the inflated endotracheal tube cuff in the distal trachea.\n\n This technique offers a significant mitigation for the risk of virus aerosolization during the procedure.\n\n\nResults\nFrom March 10 to April 15, 2020, 270 patients with COVID-19 required invasive mechanical ventilation at New York University Langone Health Manhattan’s campus; of those, 98 patients underwent percutaneous dilational tracheostomy.\n\n The mean time from intubation to the procedure was 10.6 ± 5 days.\n\n Currently, 32 patients (33%) do not require mechanical ventilatory support, 19 (19%) have their tracheostomy tube downsized, and 8 (8%) were decannulated.\n\n Forty patients (41%) remain on full ventilator support, and 19 (19%) are weaning from mechanical ventilation.\n\n Seven patients (7%) died as a result of respiratory and multiorgan failure.\n\n Tracheostomy-related bleeding was the most common complication (5 patients).\n\n None of health care providers has had symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19.\nConclusions\nOur percutaneous tracheostomy technique appears to be safe and effective for COVID-19 patients and safe for health care

were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included

(39%) patients had died and 94 (37%) remained hospitalised.\n\n 203 (79%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation for a median of 18 days (IQR 9–28), 170 (66%) of 257 patients received vasopressors and 79 (31%) received renal replacement therapy.\n\n The median time to in-hospital deterioration was 3 days (IQR 1–6).\n\n In the multivariable Cox model, older age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1·31 [1·09–1·57] per 10-year increase), chronic cardiac disease (aHR 1·76 [1·08–2·86]), chronic pulmonary disease (aHR 2·94 [1·48–5·84]), higher concentrations of interleukin-6 (aHR 1·11

tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic","abstract":"Purpose\nid='Par1'>The COVID-19 pandemic is placing unprecedented demand upon critical care services for invasive mechanical ventilation.\n\n There is current uncertainty regarding the role of tracheostomy for weaning ventilated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n This is due to a number of factors including prognosis, optimal healthcare resource utilisation, and safety of healthcare workers when performing such a high-risk aerosol-generating procedure.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Literature review and proposed practical guideline based on the experience of a tertiary healthcare institution with 195 critical care admissions for COVID-19 up until 4th April 2020.\nResults\nid='Par3'>A synthesis of the current international literature and reported experience is presented with respect to prognosis, viral load and staff safety, thus leading to a pragmatic recommendation that tracheostomy is not performed until at least 14 days after endotracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients.\n\n Practical steps to minimise aerosol generation in percutaneous tracheostomy are outlined and we describe the process and framework for setting up a dedicated tracheostomy team.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>In selected COVID-19 patients, there is a role for tracheostomy to aid in weaning and optimise healthcare resource utilisation.\n\n Both percutaneous and open techniques can be performed safely with careful modifications to technique and appropriate enhanced personal protective equipment.\n\n ORL-HNS surgeons can play a valuable role

the physical conversion of a standard positive pressure operating theatre into a negative pressure environment, problems encountered, airflow design, and evaluation of performance.\n Since entering regular service, routine measurements and observations have indicated that the airflow performance has been satisfactory.\n This has also been confirmed by regular air sampling checks.\n Computational fluid dynamics, a computer modelling technique, was used to compare the distribution of room air before and after the design changes from positive to negative pressure.\n The simulation results show

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41

(one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41

Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19 — Preliminary Report","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is associated with diffuse lung damage.\n\n Glucocorticoids may modulate inflammation-mediated lung injury and thereby reduce progression to respiratory failure and death.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this controlled, open-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments in patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.\n\n Here, we report the preliminary results of this comparison.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4321 to receive usual care.\n\n Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) in the dexamethasone group and 1110 patients (25.7%) in the usual care group died within 28 days after randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.93; P&lt;0.001).\n\n The proportional and absolute between-group differences in mortality varied considerably according to the level of respiratory support that the patients were receiving at the time of randomization.\n\n In the dexamethasone group, the incidence of death was lower than that in the usual care group among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs.\n\n 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81) and among those receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3% vs.\n\n 26.2%; rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94) but not among those who were receiving no respiratory support at randomization (17.8% vs.\n\n 14.0%; rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.55).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization but not among those receiving no respiratory support.\n\n (Funded by the Medical Research Council and National Institute for Health Research and others; RECOVERY ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov number, NCT04381936;

COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge.\n\n Biomarkers have always played an important role in clinical decision making in various infectious diseases.\n\n It is crucial to assess the role of biomarkers in evaluating severity of disease and appropriate allocation of resources.\n\n\nDesign and setting\nSystematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n English full text observational studies describing the laboratory findings and outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalised patients were identified searching PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, medRxiv using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2 OR 2019-nCoV from 1 December 2019 to 15 August 2020 following Meta-analyses Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines.\n\n\nParticipants\nStudies having biomarkers, including lymphocyte, platelets, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine, procalcitonin (PCT) and creatine kinase (CK), and describing outcomes were selected with the consensus of three independent reviewers.\n\n\nMain outcome measures\nComposite poor outcomes include intensive care unit

diseases may increase the risk of transmission.\n\n A fast and convenient differential diagnosis between COVID-19 and influenza has significant clinical value, especially for low- and middle-income countries with a shortage of nucleic acid detection kits.\n\n We aimed to establish a diagnostic model to differentiate COVID-19 and influenza based on clinical data.\n\n\nMaterial/Methods\nA total of 493 patients were enrolled in the study, including 282 with COVID-19 and 211 with influenza.\n\n All data were collected and reviewed retrospectively.\n\n The clinical and laboratory characteristics of all patients were analyzed and compared.\n\n We then randomly divided all patients into development sets and validation sets to establish a diagnostic model using multivariate logistic regression analysis.\n\n Finally, we validated the diagnostic model using the validation set.\n\n\nResults\nWe preliminarily established a diagnostic model for differentiating COVID-19 from influenza that consisted of 5 variables: age, dry cough, fever, white cell count, and D-dimer.\n\n The model showed good performance for differential diagnosis.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis initial model including clinical features and laboratory indices effectively differentiated COVID-19 from influenza.\n\n Patients with a high score were at a high risk of having COVID-19, while patients with a low score were at a high risk of having influenza.\n\n This model could help clinicians quickly identify and isolate cases in the absence of nucleic acid tests, especially during the cocirculation of COVID-19 and influenza.\n\n Owing to the study’s retrospective nature, further prospective study is needed to validate the accuracy of the

We compiled laboratory results from the first 14 days of the hospitalized patients using parameters that are most significantly different between COVID-19 and influenza and hierarchically clustered COVID-19 patients.\n\n\nFindings\nCompared to influenza, patients with COVID-19 exhibited a continued increase in white blood cell count, rapid decline of hemoglobin, more rapid increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and D-dimer, and higher level of alanine transaminase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and fibrinogen.\n\n COVID-19 patients were sub-classified into 5 clusters through a hierarchical clustering analysis.\n\n Medical records were reviewed and patients were risk stratified based on the clinical outcomes.\n\n The cluster with the highest risk showed 27·8% fatality, 94% ICU admission, 94% intubation, and 28% discharge rates compared to 0%, 38%, 22%, and 88% in the lowest risk cluster, respectively.\n\n Patients in the highest risk cluster had leukocytosis including neutrophilia and monocytosis, severe anemia, increased red blood cell distribution width, higher BUN, creatinine, D-dimer, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and troponin.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThere are significant differences in the clinical and laboratory courses between COVID-19 and influenza.\n\n Risk stratification in hospitalized COVID-19 patients using laboratory data could be useful to predict clinical outcomes and pathophysiology of these patients.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease, Department of Defense, and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7564523","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Mei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Samuel E.","surname":"Weinberg","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lihui","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Adam","surname":"Frink","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Qi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Amir","surname":"Behdad","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Ji","email":"peng-ji@fsm.northwestern.edu","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical characteristics of refractory COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Impact of sex and gender on COVID-19 outcomes in Europe","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"10.20452/pamw.15312","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Retrospective study of risk factors for severe SARS-Cov-2 infections in hospitalized adult patients","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nSince December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key Research and Development Program of China; The Beijing Science and Technology Project; and Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ronghui","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lulu","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xudong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shengjin","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References":[{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1097","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China: challenges for global health governance","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.07.937862","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: the species and its viruses:a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Short term outcome and risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes in adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020.

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in

two methods: analysis of early versus late tracheostomy and landmark analysis.\n\n\nStudy Design\nRetrospective cohort study.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients who were emergently intubated and admitted into the intensive care unit or high dependency unit between January 2011 and August 2016, with or without tracheostomy, were included.\n\n In the early and late tracheostomy analysis, all patients were divided into early (?10?days, n =?88) and late (&gt;10?days, n?=?132) groups.\n\n In the landmark analysis, 198 patients requiring ventilation for more than 10?days were divided into early tracheostomy (?10?days, n?=?57) and nonearly tracheostomy (&gt;10?days, n?=?141) groups.\n\n We compared 60?day ventilation withdrawal rate and 60?day mortality.\n\n\nResults\nEarly tracheostomy was a significant factor for early ventilation withdrawal, as shown by log?rank test results (early and late tracheostomy: P =?.\n\n001, landmark: P?=?.\n\n021).\n\n Multivariable analysis showed that the early group was also associated with a higher chance of ventilation withdrawal in each analysis (early and late tracheostomy: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]?=?1.69, 95% confidence interval

10?days of admission was independently associated with shortened duration of mechanical ventilation; 60?day mortality was not associated with the timing of tracheostomy.\n\n\nLevel of

often performed for prolonged endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients.\n\n However, in the context of COVID-19, tracheostomy placement pathways have been altered due to the poor prognosis of intubated patients and the risk of transmission to providers through this highly aerosolizing procedure.\n\n\nMethods:\nA prospective single-system multi-center observational cohort study was performed on patients who underwent tracheostomy after acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19.\nResults:\nOf the 53 patients who underwent tracheostomy, the average time from endotracheal intubation to tracheostomy was 19.7 days?±?6.9 days.\n\n The most common indication for tracheostomy was acute respiratory distress syndrome, followed by failure to wean ventilation and post-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation decannulation.\n\n Thirty patients (56.6%) were liberated from the ventilator, 16 (30.2%) have been discharged alive, 7 (13.2%) have been decannulated, and 6

and timing for tracheostomy in patients with SARS CoV2-related","abstract":"Background\nThe indications and timing for tracheostomy in patients with SARS CoV2-related are controversial.\n\n\n\nPurpose\nIn a recent issue published in the European Archives of Otorhinolaryngology, Mattioli et al.\n\n published a short communication about tracheostomy timing in patients with COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019); they reported that the tracheostomy could allow early Intensive Care Units discharge and, in the context of prolonged Invasive Mechanical Ventilation, should be suggested within 7 and 14 days to avoid potential tracheal damages.\n\n In this Letter to the Editor we would like to present our experience with tracheostomy in a Hub Covid Hospital.\n\n\n\nMethods\n8 patients underwent open tracheostomy in case of intubation prolonged over 14 days, bronchopulmonary overlap infections, and patients undergoing weaning.\n\n They were followed up and the number and timing of death were recorded.\n\n\nResults\n\nTwo patients died after tracheostomy; the median time between tracheostomy and death was 3 days.\n\n A negative prognostic trend was observed for a shorter duration of intubation.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn our experience, tracheostomy does not seem to influence the clinical course and prognosis of the disease, in the face of possible risks of contagion for healthcare workers.\n\n The indication for tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients should be carefully evaluated and reserved for selected patients.\n\n Although it is not possible to define an optimal timing, it is our opinion that tracheostomy in a stable or clinically improved COVID-19 patient should not be proposed before the 20th day after orotracheal intubation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7250256","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Emanuele","surname":"Ferri","email":"emanuele.ferri@aulss6.veneto.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Francesca","surname":"Boscolo

different groups by statistical method.\n From 7 January to 11 February 2020, 54 medical staff of Tongji Hospital were hospitalized due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19).\n Most of them were from other clinical departments (72.2%) rather than emergency department (3.7%) or medical technology departments (18.5%).\n Among the 54 patients with COVID?19, the distribution of age had a significant difference between non?severe type and severe/critical cases (median age: 47 years vs 38 years; P?=?.\n0015).\n However, there was no statistical difference in terms of gender distribution and the first symptoms between theses two groups.\n Furthermore, we observed that the lesion regions in SARS?Cov?2 infected lungs with severe?/critical?type of medical staff were more likely to exhibit lesions in the right upper lobe (31.7% vs 0%; P?=?.\n028) and right lung (61% vs 18.2%; P?=?.\n012).\n Based on our findings with medical staff infection data, we suggest training for all hospital

responses to SARS-CoV-2 in patients of novel coronavirus disease 2019","abstract":"Background\nThe novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging virus.\n\n The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 173 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled.\n\n Their serial plasma samples (n=535) collected during the hospitalization were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of antibodies with the disease progress was analyzed.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1%, 82.7% and 64.7%, respectively.\n\n The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness.\n\n The median seroconversion time for Ab, IgM and then IgG were day-11, day-12 and day-14, separately.\n\n The presence of antibodies was &lt;40% among patients within 1-week since onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0% (Ab), 94.3% (IgM) and 79.8% (IgG) since day-15 after onset.\n\n In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day-7 to 45.5% (25/55) during day 15-39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (p&lt;0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p=0.007).\n\n Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p=0.006).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184337","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Juanjuan","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Quan","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Haiyan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuejiao","surname":"Liao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yingying","surname":"Su","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tingdong","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinxiu","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shen","surname":"Qian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Congming","surname":"Hong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fuxiang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yingxia","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoqin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiyong","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tianying","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Fu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shengxiang","surname":"Ge","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ningshao","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangzheng1975@aliyun.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical

During the next two months, it moved rapidly throughout China.\n Most of the infected patients have mild symptoms including fever, fatigue and cough, but in severe cases, patients can progress rapidly and develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.\n The new coronavirus was reported to spread via droplets, contact and natural aerosols from human to human.\n Therefore, aerosol-producing procedures such as endotracheal intubation may put the anesthesiologists at high risk of nosocomial infections.\n In fact, SARS-CoV-2 infection of anesthesiologists after endotracheal intubation for confirmed COVID-19 patients have been reported in hospitals in Wuhan.\n The expert panel of airway management in Chinese Society of Anaesthesiology has deliberated and drafted this recommendation, by which we hope to guide the performance of endotracheal intubation by frontline anesthesiologists and critical care physicians.\n During the airway management, enhanced droplet/airborne personal protective equitment (PPE) should be applied to the health care providers.\n A good airway assessment before airway intervention is of vital importance.\n For patients with normal airway, awake intubation should be avoided, and modified rapid sequence induction is strongly recommended.\n Sufficient muscle relaxant should be assured before intubation.\n For patients with difficult airway, good preparation of airway devices and detailed intubation plans should be made.\n","id":"PMC7367670","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mingzhang","surname":"Zuo","email":"zuomz@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuguang","surname":"Huang","email":"garybeijing@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wuhua","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhanggang","surname":"Xue","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiaqiang","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yahong","surname":"Gong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Che","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamaoto.2020.0488","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Practical

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension

enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had

outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), consistent and considerable differences in disease severity and mortality rate of patients treated in Hubei province compared to those in other parts of China have been observed.\n\n We sought to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients being treated inside and outside Hubei province, and explore the factors underlying these differences.\n\n\nMethods\nCollaborating with the National Health Commission, we established a retrospective cohort to study hospitalised COVID-19 cases in China.\n\n Clinical characteristics, the rate of severe events and deaths, and the time to critical illness (invasive ventilation or intensive care unit admission or death) were compared between patients within and outside Hubei.\n\n The impact of Wuhan-related exposure (a presumed key factor that drove the severe situation in Hubei, as Wuhan is the epicentre as well the administrative centre of Hubei province) and the duration between symptom onset and admission on prognosis were also determined.\n\n\nResults\nAt the data cut-off (31 January 2020), 1590 cases from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions were collected (core cohort).\n\n The overall rate of severe cases and mortality was 16.0% and 3.2%, respectively.\n\n Patients in Hubei (predominantly with Wuhan-related exposure, 597 (92.3%) out of 647) were older (mean age 49.7 versus 44.9?years), had more cases with comorbidity (32.9% versus 19.7%), higher symptomatic burden, abnormal radiologic manifestations and, especially, a longer waiting time between symptom onset and admission (5.7 versus 4.5?days) compared with patients outside Hubei.\n\n Patients in Hubei (severe event rate 23.0% versus 11.1%, death rate 7.3% versus 0.3%, HR (95% CI) for critical illness 1.59 (1.05–2.41)) have a poorer prognosis compared with patients outside Hubei after adjusting for age and comorbidity.\n\n However, among patients outside Hubei, the duration from symptom onset to hospitalisation (mean 4.4 versus 4.7?days) and prognosis (HR (95%) 0.84 (0.40–1.80)) were similar between patients with or without Wuhan-related exposure.\n\n In the overall population, the waiting time, but neither treated in Hubei nor Wuhan-related exposure, remained an independent prognostic factor (HR (95%) 1.05 (1.01–1.08)).\n\n\nConclusion\nThere were more severe cases and poorer outcomes for COVID-19 patients treated in Hubei, which might be attributed to the prolonged duration of symptom onset to hospitalisation in the epicentre.\n\n Future studies to determine the reason for delaying hospitalisation are warranted.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7144336","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wen-hua","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei-jie","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cai-chen","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi-min","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Heng-rui","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-qing","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ling","surname":"Sang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ru-chong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-li","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-hua","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zi-sheng","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sook-San","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Zanin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-fu","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li-min","surname":"Ou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shan","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhan-hong","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-liang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi-xiang","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ya-hua","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-ming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ji-yang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-jian","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shao-qin","surname":"Qiu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chang-jiang","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shao-yong","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-ling","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Feng","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shi-yue","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin-ping","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nuo-fu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nan-shan","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-xing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30230-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Tracheostomy

?6.76 (P &lt;0.0001)); I2?=?97% (P &lt;0.00001)) and reduced odds for stoma inflammation (OR, 0.38 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.76 (P?=?0.006)); I2?=?2% (P?=?0.36)), and infection (OR, 0.22 (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.41 (P &lt;0.00001)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.54)), but increased odds for procedural technical difficulties (OR, 4.58 (95% CI, 2.21 to 9.47 (P &lt;0.0001)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.63)).\n\n PT techniques reduced odds for postprocedural major bleeding (OR, 0.39 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.97 (P?=?0.04)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.69)), but not when a single RCT using translaryngeal tracheostomy was excluded (OR, 0.58 (95% CI, 0.21 to 1.63 (P?=?0.30)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.89)).\n\n Eight RCTs compared different PT techniques in 700 patients.\n\n Multiple (MDT) and single step (SSDT) dilatator techniques are associated with the lowest odds for difficult dilatation or cannula insertion (OR, 0.30 (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.80 (P?=?0.02)); I2?=?56% (P?=?0.03)) and major intraprocedural bleeding (OR, 0.29 (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.85 (P?=?0.02)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.72)), compared to the guide wire dilatation forceps technique.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn critically ill adult patients, PT techniques can be performed faster and reduce stoma inflammation and infection but are associated with increased technical difficulties when compared to ST.\n\n Among PT techniques, MDT and SSDT were associated with the lowest intraprocedural risks and seem to be preferable.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13054-014-0544-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

otolaryngology procedures and the need for enhanced PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic: a literature review","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Adequate personal protective equipment is needed to reduce the rate of transmission of COVID-19 to health care workers.\n\n Otolaryngology groups are recommending a higher level of personal protective equipment for aerosol-generating procedures than public health agencies.\n\n The objective of the review was to provide evidence that a.\n\n) demonstrates which otolaryngology procedures are aerosol-generating, and that b.\n\n) clarifies whether the higher level of PPE advocated by otolaryngology groups is justified.\n\n\nMain body\nid='Par2'>Health care workers in China who performed tracheotomy during the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic had 4.15 times greater odds of contracting the virus than controls who did not perform tracheotomy (95% CI 2.75–7.54).\n\n No other studies provide direct epidemiological evidence of increased aerosolized transmission of viruses during otolaryngology procedures.\n\n Experimental evidence has shown that electrocautery, advanced energy devices, open suctioning, and drilling can create aerosolized biological particles.\n\n The viral load of COVID-19 is highest in the upper aerodigestive tract, increasing the likelihood that aerosols generated during procedures of the upper aerodigestive tract of infected patients would carry viral material.\n\n Cough and normal breathing create aerosols which may increase the risk of transmission during outpatient procedures.\n\n A significant proportion of individuals infected with COVID-19 may not have symptoms, raising the likelihood of transmission of the disease to inadequately protected health care workers from patients who do not have probable or confirmed infection.\n\n Powered air purifying respirators, if used properly, provide a greater level of filtration than N95 masks and thus may reduce the risk of transmission.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par3'>Direct and indirect evidence suggests that a large number of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery procedures are aerosol generating.\n\n Otolaryngologists are likely at high risk of contracting COVID-19 during aerosol generating procedures because they are likely exposed to high viral loads in patients infected with the virus.\n\n Based on the precautionary principle, even though the evidence is not definitive, adopting enhanced personal protective equipment protocols is reasonable based on the evidence.\n\n Further research is needed to clarify the risk associated with performing various procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the degree to which various personal protective equipment reduces the

prolonged intubation for mechanical ventilation to support breathing; thus, the artificial airway must be managed by tracheotomy.\n\n Therefore, studies exploring appropriate and safe methods for tracheotomy that minimize the risks of nosocomial transmission are important.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA retrospective analysis of the clinical characteristics of 14 critically ill patients with COVID-19, who underwent bedside tracheotomy from March to April 2020 was conducted to summarize the indications for tracheotomy and key points related to personal protective equipment and surgical procedures.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll 14 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 and were critically ill.\n\n All tracheotomies were performed in the late phase of the infection course.\n\n The interval between the infection and tracheotomy was 33?days, and the median interval between intubation and tracheotomy was 25.5?days.\n\n The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results of secretions from the operative incision and inside the tracheotomy tube were negative.\n\n Twelve patients improved after tracheotomy, with SpO2 levels maintained above 96%.\n\n One patient died of progressive

a high likelihood of needing prolonged intubation and may subsequently require tracheotomy.\n\n Usually, the choice of technique (percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy [PDT] versus open surgical tracheotomy [OST]) depends on the preference of surgeons and patient-related factors.\n\n In case of COVID-19, airborne spread of viral particles and limited time of apnea must be considered in the choice of the safest technique.\n\n The aim of this study is to compare the complication rates and offer an assessment of relative risks and benefits of PDT versus OST in patients with severe COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe performed a retrospective study considering 47 consecutive patients affected by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, needing invasive mechanical ventilation and subsequent tracheostomy.\n\n This study was performed at the Intensive Care Unit of our tertiary referral center.\n\n Complication rates were analyzed.\n\n\nResults\nSeventeen patients underwent PDT and 30 patients were submitted to OST.\n\n Twenty-six patients (55.3%) had post-operative complications (local infection, hemorrhage, subcutaneous emphysema) with no significant difference between PDT and OST.\n\n\nConclusion\nPDT and OST are characterized by similar postoperative complication rates in severe COVID-19 patients.\n\n These findings suggest that OST might be preferred if expert ENT surgeons are available, as PDT could result in longer apnea and exposure to generated aerosol.\n\n However, authors recommend considering either OST or PDT at the discretion of the medical staff involved, according to the personal experience of the operators performing the

Second and Third Wave of 1918–1919 Influenza Pandemic","abstract":"Background\nIt is widely accepted that the shift in case-fatality rate between waves during the 1918 influenza pandemic was due to a genetic change in the virus.\n\n In animal models, the infectious dose of influenza A virus was associated to the severity of disease which lead us to propose a new hypothesis.\n\n We propose that the increase in the case-fatality rate can be explained by the dynamics of disease and by a dose-dependent response mediated by the number of simultaneous contacts a susceptible person has with infectious ones.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used a compartment model with seasonality, waning of immunity and a Holling type II function, to model simultaneous contacts between a susceptible person and infectious ones.\n\n In the model, infected persons having mild or severe illness depend both on the proportion of infectious persons in the population and on the level of simultaneous contacts between a susceptible and infectious persons.\n\n We further allowed for a high or low rate of waning immunity and volunteer isolation at different times of the epidemic.\n\n\nResults\nIn all scenarios, case-fatality rate was low during the first wave (Spring) due to a decrease in the effective reproduction number.\n\n The case-fatality rate in the second wave (Autumn) depended on the ratio between the number of severe cases to the number of mild cases since, for each 1000 mild infections only 4 deaths occurred whereas for 1000 severe infections there were 20 deaths.\n\n A third wave (late Winter) was dependent on the rate for waning immunity or on the introduction of new susceptible persons in the community.\n\n If a group of persons became voluntarily isolated and returned to the community some days latter, new waves occurred.\n\n For a fixed number of infected persons the overall case-fatality rate decreased as the number of waves increased.\n\n This is explained by the lower proportion of infectious individuals in each wave that prevented an increase in the number of severe infections and thus of the case-fatality rate.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe increase on the proportion of

For half of the subjects, viral plaque assays were performed on the nasopharyngeal swabs and cough aerosol samples to determine if viable virus was present.\n Fifty-eight subjects were tested, of whom 47 were positive for influenza virus by qPCR.\n Influenza viral RNA was detected in coughs from 38 of these subjects (81%).\n Thirty-five percent of the influenza RNA was contained in particles &gt;4 µm in aerodynamic diameter, while 23% was in particles 1 to 4 µm and 42% in particles &lt;1 µm.\n Viable influenza virus was detected in the cough aerosols from 2 of 21 subjects with influenza.\n These results show that coughing by influenza patients emits aerosol particles containing influenza virus and that much of the viral RNA is contained within particles in the respirable size range.\n The results support the idea that the airborne route may be a pathway for influenza transmission, especially in the immediate vicinity of an influenza patient.\n Further research is needed on the viability of airborne influenza viruses and the risk of transmission.\n","id":"PMC2994911","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"William G.","surname":"Lindsley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Francoise M.","surname":"Blachere","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert E.","surname":"Thewlis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Abhishek","surname":"Vishnu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kristina A.","surname":"Davis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jan E.","surname":"Palmer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Karen E.","surname":"Clark","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Melanie A.","surname":"Fisher","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rashida","surname":"Khakoo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Donald H.","surname":"Beezhold","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andrew","surname":"Pekosz","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Andrew","surname":"Pekosz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1164/rccm.201203-0444OC","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Variability of infectious aerosols produced during coughing by patients with pulmonary tuberculosis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Hassan SM, Trotter MI.

some 15% will develop severe complaints and among them, many will lose their lives.\n A large number of patients do not have overt signs and symptoms (fever/respiratory), yet pose a real risk to surgeons (who should know this fact and must therefore apply respiratory protective strategies for all patients they encounter).\n All interventions that have the potential to aerosolize aerodigestive secretions should be avoided or used only when mandatory.\n Health workers who are: pregnant, over 55 to 65?years of age, with a history of chronic diseases (uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and all clinical scenarios where immunosuppression is feasible, including that induced to treat chronic inflammatory conditions and organ transplants) should avoid the clinical attention of a potentially infected patient.\n Health care facilities should prioritize urgent and emergency visits and procedures until the present condition stabilizes; truly elective care should cease and discussed on a case?by?case basis for patients with cancer.\n For those who are working with COVID?19 infected patients' isolation is compulsory in the following settings: (a) unprotected close contact with COVID?19 pneumonia patients; (b) onset of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and other symptoms (gastrointestinal complaints, anosmia, and dysgeusia have been reported in a minority of cases).\n For any care or intervention in the upper aerodigestive tract region, irrespective of the setting and a confirmed diagnosis (eg, rhinoscopy or flexible laryngoscopy in the outpatient setting and tracheostomy or rigid endoscopy under anesthesia), it is strongly recommended that all health care personnel wear personal protective equipment such as N95, gown, cap, eye protection, and gloves.\n The procedures described are essential in trying to maintain safety of health care workers during COVID?19 pandemic.\n In particular, otolaryngologists, head and neck, and maxillofacial surgeons are per se exposed to the greatest risk of infection while caring for COVID?19 positive subjects, and their protection should be considered a priority in the present circumstances.\n","id":"PMC7262203","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Luiz P.","surname":"Kowalski","email":"lp_kowalski@uol.com.br","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alvaro","surname":"Sanabria","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Alvaro","surname":"Sanabria","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"John A.","surname":"Ridge","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"John A.","surname":"Ridge","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wai Tong","surname":"Ng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Remco","surname":"de Bree","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Remco","surname":"de Bree","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alessandra","surname":"Rinaldo","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Alessandra","surname":"Rinaldo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robert P.","surname":"Takes","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Antti A.","surname":"Mäkitie","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Antti A.","surname":"Mäkitie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andre L.","surname":"Carvalho","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Carol R.","surname":"Bradford","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vinidh","surname":"Paleri","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Vinidh","surname":"Paleri","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dana M.","surname":"Hartl","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vincent","surname":"Vander Poorten","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Iain J.","surname":"Nixon","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Iain J.","surname":"Nixon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cesare","surname":"Piazza","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cesare","surname":"Piazza","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter D.","surname":"Lacy","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Peter D.","surname":"Lacy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Juan P.","surname":"Rodrigo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Orlando","surname":"Guntinas?Lichius","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Orlando","surname":"Guntinas?Lichius","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"William M.","surname":"Mendenhall","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"William M.","surname":"Mendenhall","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anil","surname":"D'Cruz","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Anil","surname":"D'Cruz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anne W.

guidance","abstract":"Global health care is experiencing an unprecedented surge in the number of critically ill patients who require mechanical ventilation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n The requirement for relatively long periods of ventilation in those who survive means that many are considered for tracheostomy to free patients from ventilatory support and maximise scarce resources.\n COVID-19 provides unique challenges for tracheostomy care: health-care workers need to safely undertake tracheostomy procedures and manage patients afterwards, minimising risks of nosocomial transmission and compromises in the quality of care.\n Conflicting recommendations exist about case selection, the timing and performance of tracheostomy, and the subsequent management of patients.\n In response, we convened an international working group of individuals with relevant expertise in tracheostomy.\n We did a literature and internet search for reports of research pertaining to tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic, supplemented by sources comprising statements and guidance on tracheostomy care.\n By synthesising early experiences from countries that have managed a surge in patient numbers, emerging virological data, and international, multidisciplinary expert opinion, we aim to provide consensus guidelines and recommendations on the conduct and management of tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n","id":"PMC7228735","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Brendan

to worldwide, which has attracted many people's concerns about the patients.\n However, studies on the infection status of medical personnel is still lacking.\n A total of 54 cases of SARS?Cov?2 infected medical staff from Tongji Hospital between 7 January and 11 February 2020 were analyzed in this retrospective study.\n Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were compared between different groups by statistical method.\n From 7 January to 11 February 2020, 54 medical staff of Tongji Hospital were hospitalized due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19).\n Most of them were from other clinical departments (72.2%) rather than emergency department (3.7%) or medical technology departments (18.5%).\n Among the 54 patients with COVID?19, the distribution of age had a significant difference between non?severe type and severe/critical cases (median age: 47 years vs 38 years; P?=?.\n0015).\n However, there was no statistical difference in terms of gender distribution and the first symptoms between theses two groups.\n Furthermore, we observed that the lesion regions in SARS?Cov?2 infected lungs with severe?/critical?type of medical staff were more likely to exhibit lesions in the right upper lobe (31.7% vs 0%; P?=?.\n028) and right lung (61% vs 18.2%; P?=?.\n012).\n Based on our findings with medical staff infection data, we suggest training for all hospital

responses to SARS-CoV-2 in patients of novel coronavirus disease 2019","abstract":"Background\nThe novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging virus.\n\n The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 173 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled.\n\n Their serial plasma samples (n=535) collected during the hospitalization were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of antibodies with the disease progress was analyzed.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1%, 82.7% and 64.7%, respectively.\n\n The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness.\n\n The median seroconversion time for Ab, IgM and then IgG were day-11, day-12 and day-14, separately.\n\n The presence of antibodies was &lt;40% among patients within 1-week since onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0% (Ab), 94.3% (IgM) and 79.8% (IgG) since day-15 after onset.\n\n In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day-7 to 45.5% (25/55) during day 15-39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (p&lt;0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p=0.007).\n\n Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p=0.006).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19

During the next two months, it moved rapidly throughout China.\n Most of the infected patients have mild symptoms including fever, fatigue and cough, but in severe cases, patients can progress rapidly and develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.\n The new coronavirus was reported to spread via droplets, contact and natural aerosols from human to human.\n Therefore, aerosol-producing procedures such as endotracheal intubation may put the anesthesiologists at high risk of nosocomial infections.\n In fact, SARS-CoV-2 infection of anesthesiologists after endotracheal intubation for confirmed COVID-19 patients have been reported in hospitals in Wuhan.\n The expert panel of airway management in Chinese Society of Anaesthesiology has deliberated and drafted this recommendation, by which we hope to guide the performance of endotracheal intubation by frontline anesthesiologists and critical care physicians.\n During the airway management, enhanced droplet/airborne personal protective equitment (PPE) should be applied to the health care providers.\n A good airway assessment before airway intervention is of vital importance.\n For patients with normal airway, awake intubation should be avoided, and modified rapid sequence induction is strongly recommended.\n Sufficient muscle relaxant should be assured before intubation.\n For patients with difficult airway, good preparation of airway devices and detailed intubation plans should be made.\n","id":"PMC7367670","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mingzhang","surname":"Zuo","email":"zuomz@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuguang","surname":"Huang","email":"garybeijing@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wuhua","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhanggang","surname":"Xue","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiaqiang","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yahong","surname":"Gong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Che","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamaoto.2020.0488","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Practical

surgical tracheostomy (ST), and if one PT technique is superior to the others.\n\n\nMethods\nComputerized databases (1966 to 2013) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting complications as predefined endpoints and comparing PT and ST and among the different PT techniques in mechanically ventilated adult critically ill patients.\n\n Odds ratios (OR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI), and I2 values were estimated.\n\n\nResults\nFourteen RCTs tested PT techniques versus ST in 973 patients.\n\n PT techniques were performed faster (MD, ?13.06 minutes (95% CI, ?19.37 to ?6.76 (P &lt;0.0001)); I2?=?97% (P &lt;0.00001)) and reduced odds for stoma inflammation (OR, 0.38 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.76 (P?=?0.006)); I2?=?2% (P?=?0.36)), and infection (OR, 0.22 (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.41 (P &lt;0.00001)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.54)), but increased odds for procedural technical difficulties (OR, 4.58 (95% CI, 2.21 to 9.47 (P &lt;0.0001)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.63)).\n\n PT techniques reduced odds for postprocedural major bleeding (OR, 0.39 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.97 (P?=?0.04)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.69)), but not when a single RCT using translaryngeal tracheostomy was excluded (OR, 0.58 (95% CI, 0.21 to 1.63 (P?=?0.30)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.89)).\n\n Eight RCTs compared different PT techniques in 700 patients.\n\n Multiple (MDT) and single step (SSDT) dilatator techniques are associated with the lowest odds for difficult dilatation or cannula insertion (OR, 0.30 (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.80 (P?=?0.02)); I2?=?56% (P?=?0.03)) and major intraprocedural bleeding (OR, 0.29 (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.85 (P?=?0.02)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.72)), compared to the guide wire dilatation forceps technique.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn critically ill adult patients, PT techniques can be performed faster and reduce stoma inflammation and infection but are associated with increased technical difficulties when compared to ST.\n\n Among PT techniques, MDT and SSDT were associated with the lowest intraprocedural risks and seem to be preferable.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13054-014-0544-7) contains supplementary material,

bibliographies and selected conference proceedings were reviewed, and experts in the field and manufacturers of two PDT kits were contacted.\n\n Randomized clinical trials comparing any method of elective PDT to ST that included critically ill adults and reported at least one clinically relevant outcome were included.\n\n Data extracted included trial characteristics, measures of study validity, and clinically relevant outcomes.\n\n\nResults\nSeventeen RCTs involving 1,212 patients were included.\n\n Most PDTs used a multiple dilator technique and were performed in the intensive care unit (ICU).\n\n The pooled odds ratio (OR) for wound infection was 0.28 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.16 to 0.49, p &lt; 0.0005), indicating a significant reduction with PDT compared to ST.\n\n Overall, PDT was equivalent to ST for bleeding, major peri-procedural and long-term complications; however, subgroup analysis suggested PDT resulted in a lower incidence of bleeding (OR = 0.29 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.75, p = 0.01)) and death (OR = 0.71 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.0, p = 0.05)) when the STs were performed in the operating theatre.\n\n\nConclusion\nPDT reduces the overall incidence of wound infection and may further reduce clinical relevant bleeding and mortality when compared with ST performed in the operating theatre.\n\n PDT, performed in the ICU, should be considered the procedure of choice for performing elective tracheostomies in critically ill adult patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1550905","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Anthony","surname":"Delaney","email":"adelaney@med.usyd.edu.au","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sean

patients: a meta-analysis","abstract":"Introduction\nThe aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis to determine whether percutaneous tracheostomy (PT) techniques are advantageous over surgical tracheostomy (ST), and if one PT technique is superior to the others.\n\n\nMethods\nComputerized databases (1966 to 2013) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting complications as predefined endpoints and comparing PT and ST and among the different PT techniques in mechanically ventilated adult critically ill patients.\n\n Odds ratios (OR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI), and I2 values were estimated.\n\n\nResults\nFourteen RCTs tested PT techniques versus ST in 973 patients.\n\n PT techniques were performed faster (MD, ?13.06 minutes (95% CI, ?19.37 to ?6.76 (P &lt;0.0001)); I2?=?97% (P &lt;0.00001)) and reduced odds for stoma inflammation (OR, 0.38 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.76 (P?=?0.006)); I2?=?2% (P?=?0.36)), and infection (OR, 0.22 (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.41 (P &lt;0.00001)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.54)), but increased odds for procedural technical difficulties (OR, 4.58 (95% CI, 2.21 to 9.47 (P &lt;0.0001)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.63)).\n\n PT techniques reduced odds for postprocedural major bleeding (OR, 0.39 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.97 (P?=?0.04)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.69)), but not when a single RCT using translaryngeal tracheostomy was excluded (OR, 0.58 (95% CI, 0.21 to 1.63 (P?=?0.30)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.89)).\n\n Eight RCTs compared different PT techniques in 700 patients.\n\n Multiple (MDT) and single step (SSDT) dilatator techniques are associated with the lowest odds for difficult dilatation or cannula insertion (OR, 0.30 (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.80 (P?=?0.02)); I2?=?56% (P?=?0.03)) and major intraprocedural bleeding (OR, 0.29 (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.85 (P?=?0.02)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.72)), compared to the guide wire dilatation forceps technique.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn critically ill adult patients, PT techniques can be performed faster and reduce stoma inflammation and infection but are associated with increased technical difficulties when compared to ST.\n\n Among PT techniques, MDT and SSDT were associated with the lowest intraprocedural risks and seem to be preferable.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13054-014-0544-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

With COVID-19","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic, with many patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation.\n\n Tracheostomy is not recommended by current guidelines as it is considered a superspreading event owing to aerosolization that unduly risks health care workers.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients with severe COVID-19 who were on mechanical ventilation for 5 days or longer were evaluated for percutaneous dilational tracheostomy.\n\n We developed a novel percutaneous tracheostomy technique that placed the bronchoscope alongside the endotracheal tube, not inside it.\n\n That improved visualization during the procedure and continued standard mechanical ventilation after positioning the inflated endotracheal tube cuff in the distal trachea.\n\n This technique offers a significant mitigation for the risk of virus aerosolization during the procedure.\n\n\nResults\nFrom March 10 to April 15, 2020, 270 patients with COVID-19 required invasive mechanical ventilation at New York University Langone Health Manhattan’s campus; of those, 98 patients underwent percutaneous dilational tracheostomy.\n\n The mean time from intubation to the procedure was 10.6 ± 5 days.\n\n Currently, 32 patients (33%) do not require mechanical ventilatory support, 19 (19%) have their tracheostomy tube downsized, and 8 (8%) were decannulated.\n\n Forty patients (41%) remain on full ventilator support, and 19 (19%) are weaning from mechanical ventilation.\n\n Seven patients (7%) died as a result of respiratory and multiorgan failure.\n\n Tracheostomy-related bleeding was the most common complication (5 patients).\n\n None of health care providers has had symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19.\nConclusions\nOur percutaneous tracheostomy technique appears to be safe and effective for COVID-19 patients and safe for health care workers.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7182508","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Luis","surname":"Angel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zachary

ventilation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n The requirement for relatively long periods of ventilation in those who survive means that many are considered for tracheostomy to free patients from ventilatory support and maximise scarce resources.\n COVID-19 provides unique challenges for tracheostomy care: health-care workers need to safely undertake tracheostomy procedures and manage patients afterwards, minimising risks of nosocomial transmission and compromises in the quality of care.\n Conflicting recommendations exist about case selection, the timing and performance of tracheostomy, and the subsequent management of patients.\n In response, we convened an international working group of individuals with relevant expertise in tracheostomy.\n We did a literature and internet search for reports of research pertaining to tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic, supplemented by sources comprising statements and guidance on tracheostomy care.\n By synthesising early experiences from countries that have managed a surge in patient numbers, emerging virological data, and international, multidisciplinary expert opinion, we aim to provide consensus guidelines and recommendations

caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key

controversial.\n\n\n\nPurpose\nIn a recent issue published in the European Archives of Otorhinolaryngology, Mattioli et al.\n\n published a short communication about tracheostomy timing in patients with COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019); they reported that the tracheostomy could allow early Intensive Care Units discharge and, in the context of prolonged Invasive Mechanical Ventilation, should be suggested within 7 and 14 days to avoid potential tracheal damages.\n\n In this Letter to the Editor we would like to present our experience with tracheostomy in a Hub Covid Hospital.\n\n\n\nMethods\n8 patients underwent open tracheostomy in case of intubation prolonged over 14 days, bronchopulmonary overlap infections, and patients undergoing weaning.\n\n They were followed up and the number and timing of death were recorded.\n\n\nResults\n\nTwo patients died after tracheostomy; the median time between tracheostomy and death was 3 days.\n\n A negative prognostic trend was observed for a shorter duration of intubation.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn our experience, tracheostomy does not seem to influence the clinical course and prognosis of the disease, in the face of possible risks of contagion for healthcare workers.\n\n The indication for tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients should be carefully evaluated and reserved for selected patients.\n\n Although it is not possible to define an optimal timing, it is our opinion that tracheostomy in a stable or clinically improved COVID-19 patient should not be proposed before the 20th day after orotracheal intubation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7250256","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Emanuele","surname":"Ferri","email":"emanuele.ferri@aulss6.veneto.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Francesca","surname":"Boscolo

radiological (CT scan) markers of COVID-19, and with negative nasopharyngeal sample within 24 h of surgery, are at low risk of being infected.\n Instructions for personal protection include specific wound dressings and decontamination of all material used.\n The operating room should be ventilated after each tracheostomy and the pressure of the room should be neutral or negative.\n Percutaneous tracheostomy is to be preferred over surgical cervicotomy in order to reduce aerosolization and to avoid moving patients from the intensive care unit to the operating room.\n Ventilation must be

the duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, and outcomes in trauma ICU patients.\n\n\nMethods\nThe following data were obtained from a prospective ICU database containing information on all trauma patients who received tracheostomy over a 5-year period: demographics, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, Glasgow Coma Scale score, Injury Severity Score, type of injuries, ICU and hospital outcomes, ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), and the type of tracheostomy procedure (percutaneous versus surgical).\n\n Tracheostomy was considered early if it was performed by day 7 of mechanical ventilation.\n\n We compared the duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU LOS and outcome between early and late tracheostomy patients.\n\n Multivariate analysis was performed to assess the impact of tracheostomy timing on ICU stay.\n\n\nResults\nOf 653 trauma ICU patients, 136 (21%) required tracheostomies, 29 of whom were early and 107 were late.\n\n Age, sex, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and Injury Severity Score were not different between the two groups.\n\n Patients with early tracheostomy were more likely to have maxillofacial injuries and to have lower Glasgow Coma Scale score.\n\n Duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly shorter with early tracheostomy (mean ± standard error: 9.6 ± 1.2 days versus 18.7 ± 1.3 days; P &lt; 0.0001).\n\n Similarly, ICU LOS was significantly shorter (10.9 ± 1.2 days versus

anxiety, agitation and/or pain.\n\n Current opinion is that tracheotomy reduces sedation requirements.\n\n We determined sedation needs before and after tracheotomy of intubated and mechanically ventilated patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of the use of morphine, midazolam and propofol in patients before and after tracheotomy.\n\n\nResults\nOf 1,788 patients admitted to our intensive care unit during the study period, 129 (7%) were tracheotomized.\n\n After the exclusion of patients who received a tracheotomy before or at the day of admittance, 117 patients were left for analysis.\n\n The daily dose (DD; the amount of sedatives for each day) divided by the mean daily dose (MDD; the mean amount of sedatives per day for the study period) in the week before and the week after tracheotomy was 1.07 ± 0.93 DD/MDD versus 0.30 ± 0.65 for morphine, 0.84 ± 1.03 versus 0.11 ± 0.46 for midazolam, and 0.62 ± 1.05 versus 0.15 ± 0.45 for propofol (p &lt; 0.01).\n\n However, when we focused on a shorter time interval (two days before and after tracheotomy), there were no differences in prescribed doses of morphine and midazolam.\n\n Studying the course in DD/MDD from seven days before the placement of tracheotomy, we found a significant decline in dosage.\n\n From day -7 to day -1, morphine dosage (DD/MDD) declined by 3.34 (95% confidence interval -1.61 to -6.24), midazolam dosage by 2.95 (-1.49 to -5.29) and propofol dosage by 1.05 (-0.41 to -2.01).\n\n After tracheotomy, no further decrease in DD/MDD was observed and the dosage remained stable for all sedatives.\n\n Patients in the non-surgical and acute surgical groups received higher dosages of midazolam than patients in the elective surgical group.\n\n Time until tracheotomy did not influence sedation requirements.\n\n In addition, there was no significant difference in sedation between different patient groups.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn our intensive care unit, sedation requirements were not further reduced after tracheotomy.\n\n Sedation requirements were already sharply declining before tracheotomy was performed.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1751026","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Denise

incidence of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events is reported.\n COVID-19 may lead to impairment of the coagulation cascade, with an imbalance in platelet function and the regulatory mechanisms of coagulation and fibrinolysis.\n Clinical manifestations vary from a rise in laboratory markers and subclinical microthrombi to thromboembolic events, bleeding, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n After an inflammatory trigger, the mechanism for activation of the coagulation cascade in COVID-19 is the tissue factor pathway, which causes endotoxin and tumor necrosis factor-mediated production of interleukins and platelet activation.\n The consequent massive infiltration of activated platelets may be responsible for inflammatory infiltrates in the endothelial space, as well as thrombocytopenia.\n The variety of clinical presentations of the coagulopathy confronts the clinician with the difficult questions of whether and how to provide optimal supportive care.\n In addition to coagulation tests, advanced laboratory tests such as protein C, protein S, antithrombin, tissue factor pathway inhibitors, D-dimers, activated factor Xa, and quantification of specific coagulation factors can be useful, as can thromboelastography or thromboelastometry.\n Treatment should be tailored, focusing on the estimated risk of bleeding and thrombosis.\n The aim of this review is to explore the pathophysiology and clinical evidence of coagulation disorders in severe ARDS-related COVID-19

although mechanisms underlying this process are unknown.\n Here, using combined pharmacological and gene-deletion approaches, we show that plasminogen controls lung inflammation and pathogenesis of infections with influenza A/PR/8/34, highly pathogenic H5N1 and 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses.\n Reduction of virus replication was not responsible for the observed effect.\n However, pharmacological depletion of fibrinogen, the main target of plasminogen reversed disease resistance of plasminogen-deficient mice or mice treated with an inhibitor of plasminogen-mediated fibrinolysis.\n Therefore, plasminogen contributes to the deleterious inflammation of the lungs and local fibrin clot formation may be implicated in host defense against influenza virus infections.\n Our studies suggest that

rehabilitation patients","abstract":"Background:\nA patient's infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in different body fluids, secretions, and excreta.\n\n The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear.\n\n This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence.\n\n\nMethods:\nThe clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively.\n\n The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients’ oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed.\n\n Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs.\n\n The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed.\n\n\nResults:\nIn the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study.\n\n In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0–62.0) years were analyzed.\n\n After in-hospital treatment, patients’ inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition.\n\n The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0–11.0) days.\n\n By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients’ stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0–16.0) days after symptom onset.\n\n Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0–4.0) days.\n\n Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients’ urine specimens after throat swabs were negative.\n\n Using a multiple linear regression model (F?=?2.669, P?=?0.044, and adjusted R2?=?0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients’ stools (t?=??2.699, P?=?0.010).\n\n The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs.\n\n 8.0 days, respectively; t?=?2.550, P?=?0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs.\n\n 11 days, respectively; t?=?4.631, P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P?&gt;?0.05).\n\n\nConclusions:\nIn brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients’ stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence.\n\n Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease.\n\n The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7147278","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yun","surname":"Ling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shui-Bao","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yi-Xiao","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Di","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Qin","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bi-Jie","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"En-Qiang","surname":"Mao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wen-Hong","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hong-Zhou","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Lyu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Lyu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.thromres.2018.07.003","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The

embolism, represent an important source of adverse outcomes in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).\n\n\nObjectives\nTo assess the frequency of arterial and venous thromboembolic disease, risk factors, prevention and management patterns, and outcomes in patients with COVID-19, the authors designed a multicenter, observational cohort study.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analyzed a retrospective cohort of 1,114 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed through our Mass General Brigham integrated health network.\n\n The total cohort was analyzed by site of care: intensive care (n = 170); hospitalized nonintensive care (n = 229); and outpatient (n = 715).\n\n The primary study outcome was a composite of adjudicated major arterial or venous thromboembolism.\n\n\nResults\nPatients with COVID-19 were 22.3% Hispanic/Latinx and 44.2% non-White.\n\n Cardiovascular risk factors of hypertension (35.8%), hyperlipidemia (28.6%), and diabetes (18.0%) were common.\n\n Prophylactic anticoagulation was prescribed in 89.4% of patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care cohort and 84.7% of those in the hospitalized nonintensive care setting.\n\n Frequencies of major arterial or venous thromboembolism, major cardiovascular adverse events, and symptomatic venous thromboembolism were highest in the intensive care cohort (35.3%, 45.9%, and 27.0 %, respectively) followed by the hospitalized nonintensive care cohort (2.6%, 6.1%, and 2.2%, respectively) and the outpatient cohort (0% for all).\n\n\nConclusions\nMajor arterial or venous thromboembolism, major adverse cardiovascular events, and symptomatic venous thromboembolism occurred with high frequency in patients with COVID-19, especially in the intensive care setting, despite a high utilization rate of thromboprophylaxis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7588178","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gregory","surname":"Piazza","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Umberto","surname":"Campia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shelley","surname":"Hurwitz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Julia

respiratory failure due to COVID-19 have a high likelihood of needing prolonged intubation and may subsequently require tracheotomy.\n\n Usually, the choice of technique (percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy [PDT] versus open surgical tracheotomy [OST]) depends on the preference of surgeons and patient-related factors.\n\n In case of COVID-19, airborne spread of viral particles and limited time of apnea must be considered in the choice of the safest technique.\n\n The aim of this study is to compare the complication rates and offer an assessment of relative risks and benefits of PDT versus OST in patients with severe COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe performed a retrospective study considering 47 consecutive patients affected by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to SARS-CoV-2

These findings suggest that OST might be preferred if expert ENT surgeons are available, as PDT could result in longer apnea and exposure to generated aerosol.\n\n However, authors recommend considering either OST or PDT at the discretion of the medical staff involved, according to the personal experience of the operators performing the

with severe COVID-19 who were on mechanical ventilation for 5 days or longer were evaluated for percutaneous dilational tracheostomy.\n\n We developed a novel percutaneous tracheostomy technique that placed the bronchoscope alongside the endotracheal tube, not inside it.\n\n That improved visualization during the procedure and continued standard mechanical ventilation after positioning the inflated endotracheal tube cuff in the distal trachea.\n\n This technique offers a significant mitigation for the risk of virus aerosolization during the procedure.\n\n\nResults\nFrom March 10 to April 15, 2020, 270 patients with COVID-19 required invasive mechanical ventilation at New York University Langone Health Manhattan’s campus; of those, 98 patients underwent percutaneous dilational

potential of infecting operating staff when operating on these patients.\n\n This case series describes a method of performing open tracheostomy for COVID-19 patients while minimizing potential aerosolization of the virus using typically available equipment and supplies.\n\n\nMethods\nThis is a case series of 18 patients who were COVID-19 positive and underwent open tracheostomy in the operating room under a negative pressure plastic hood created using readily available equipment and supplies.\n\n Patients had to be intubated for at least 14 days, be convalescing from their cytokine storm, and deemed to survive for at least 14 more days.\n\n Other indications for tracheostomy were altered mental status, severe deconditioning, respiratory failure and failed extubation attempts.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 14 men and 4 women with severe SARS-CoV2 infection requiring long-term intubation since March 23 or later.\n\n The mean age was 61.7, BMI was 32.6, and the pre-tracheostomy ventilator day was 20.4. The indications for tracheostomy were altered mental status, severe deconditioning and continued respiratory with hypoxia.\n\n Failed extubation attempt rate was 16.7% and hemodialysis rate was 38.9%.\n\n All patients were hemodynamically stable, without any evidence of accelerating cytokine storm.\n\n To date there was one minor bleeding due to postoperative therapeutic anticoagulation.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis report describes a method of performing open tracheostomy with minimal aerosolization using readily available equipment and supplies in most hospitals.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7253051","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kartik","surname":"Prabhakaran","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ryan","surname":"Malcom","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"James","surname":"Choi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexandra","surname":"Chudner","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Augustine","surname":"Moscatello","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Panzica","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rifat","surname":"Latifi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Rhee","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102535","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early experience in tracheostomy and tracheostomy tube management in Covid-19 patients","abstract":"In Italy, we have experienced Europe's first and largest coronavirus outbreak.\n Based on our preliminary experience, we discuss the challenges in performing tracheotomy and tracheostoma care in the setting of a new pathogen.\n","id":"PMC7204652","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ottavio","surname":"Piccin","email":"ottavio.piccin2@unibo.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Riccardo","surname":"Albertini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Umberto","surname":"Caliceti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ottavio","surname":"Cavicchi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eleonora","surname":"Cioccoloni","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marco","surname":"Demattè","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gian Gaetano","surname":"Ferri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Giovanni","surname":"Macrì","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pietro","surname":"Marrè","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Irene","surname":"Pelligra","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Domenico","surname":"Saggese","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Patrizia","surname":"Schiavon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vittorio","surname":"Sciarretta","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Giovanni","surname":"Sorrenti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/0194599820928963","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Elective tracheostomy during mechanical ventilation in patients affected by COVID-19: preliminary case series from Lombardy, Italy","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0240014","date":"2020-09-18","title":"Safety of bedside surgical tracheostomy during COVID-19 pandemic: A retrospective observational study","abstract":"Data regarding safety of bedside surgical tracheostomy in novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are lacking.\n We performed this study to assess the safety of bedside surgical tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU.\n This retrospective, single-center, cohort observational study (conducted between February, 23 and April, 30, 2020) was performed in our 45-bed dedicated COVID-19 ICU.\n Inclusion criteria were: a) age over 18 years;

procedures.\n\n\nBackground:\nTracheostomy is often performed for prolonged endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients.\n\n However, in the context of COVID-19, tracheostomy placement pathways have been altered due to the poor prognosis of intubated patients and the risk of transmission to providers through this highly aerosolizing procedure.\n\n\nMethods:\nA prospective single-system multi-center observational cohort study was performed on patients who underwent tracheostomy after acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19.\nResults:\nOf the 53 patients who underwent tracheostomy, the average time from endotracheal intubation to tracheostomy was 19.7 days?±?6.9 days.\n\n The most common indication for tracheostomy was acute respiratory distress syndrome, followed by failure to wean ventilation and post-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation decannulation.\n\n Thirty patients (56.6%) were liberated from the ventilator, 16 (30.2%) have been discharged alive, 7 (13.2%) have been decannulated, and 6 (11.3%) died.\n\n The average time from tracheostomy to ventilator liberation was 11.8 days?±?6.9 days (range 2–32 days).\n\n Both open surgical and percutaneous dilational tracheostomy techniques were performed utilizing methods to mitigate aerosols.\n\n No healthcare worker transmissions resulted from performing the procedure.\n\n\nConclusions:\nAlterations to tracheostomy practices and processes were successfully instituted.\n\n Following these steps, tracheostomy in COVID-19 intubated patients seems safe for both patients and healthcare workers performing the procedure.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7467054","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tiffany

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on

aspects of the morbidity and mortality characterizing infection with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome-associated coronavirus-2, the etiologic agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n We examined skin and lung tissues from 5 patients with severe COVID-19 characterized by respiratory failure (n= 5) and purpuric skin rash (n?=?3).\n COVID-19 pneumonitis was predominantly a pauci-inflammatory septal capillary injury with significant septal capillary mural and luminal fibrin deposition and permeation of the interalveolar septa by neutrophils.\n No viral cytopathic changes were observed and the diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with hyaline membranes, inflammation, and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, hallmarks of classic acute respiratory distress syndrome, were not prominent.\n These pulmonary findings were accompanied by significant deposits of terminal complement components C5b-9 (membrane attack complex), C4d, and mannose binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine protease (MASP)2, in the microvasculature, consistent with sustained, systemic activation of the complement pathways.\n The purpuric skin lesions similarly showed a pauci-inflammatory thrombogenic vasculopathy, with deposition of C5b-9 and C4d in both grossly involved and normally-appearing skin.\n In addition, there was co-localization of COVID-19 spike glycoproteins with C4d and C5b-9 in the interalveolar septa and the cutaneous microvasculature of 2 cases examined.\n In conclusion, at least a subset of sustained, severe COVID-19 may define a type of catastrophic microvascular injury syndrome mediated by activation of complement pathways and an associated procoagulant state.\n It provides a foundation for further exploration of the pathophysiologic importance

outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), consistent and considerable differences in disease severity and mortality rate of patients treated in Hubei province compared to those in other parts of China have been observed.\n\n We sought to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients being treated inside and outside Hubei province, and explore the factors underlying these differences.\n\n\nMethods\nCollaborating with the National Health Commission, we established a retrospective cohort to study hospitalised COVID-19 cases in China.\n\n Clinical characteristics, the rate of severe events and deaths, and the time to critical illness (invasive ventilation or intensive care unit admission or death) were compared between patients within and outside Hubei.\n\n The impact of Wuhan-related exposure (a presumed key factor that drove the severe situation in Hubei, as Wuhan is the epicentre as well the administrative centre of Hubei province) and the duration between symptom onset and admission on prognosis were also determined.\n\n\nResults\nAt the data cut-off (31 January 2020), 1590 cases from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions were collected (core cohort).\n\n The overall rate of severe cases and mortality was 16.0% and 3.2%, respectively.\n\n Patients in Hubei (predominantly with Wuhan-related exposure, 597 (92.3%) out of 647) were older (mean age 49.7 versus 44.9?years), had more cases with comorbidity (32.9% versus 19.7%), higher symptomatic burden, abnormal radiologic manifestations and, especially, a longer waiting time between symptom onset and admission (5.7 versus 4.5?days) compared with patients outside Hubei.\n\n Patients in Hubei (severe event rate 23.0% versus 11.1%, death rate 7.3% versus 0.3%, HR (95% CI) for critical illness 1.59 (1.05–2.41)) have a poorer prognosis compared with patients outside Hubei after adjusting for age and comorbidity.\n\n However, among patients outside Hubei, the duration from symptom onset to hospitalisation (mean 4.4 versus 4.7?days) and prognosis (HR (95%) 0.84 (0.40–1.80)) were similar between patients with or without Wuhan-related exposure.\n\n In the overall population, the waiting time, but neither treated in Hubei nor Wuhan-related exposure, remained an independent prognostic factor (HR (95%) 1.05 (1.01–1.08)).\n\n\nConclusion\nThere were more severe

in the COVID-19 era: global and multidisciplinary guidance","abstract":"Global health care is experiencing an unprecedented surge in the number of critically ill patients who require mechanical ventilation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n The requirement for relatively long periods of ventilation in those who survive means that many are considered for tracheostomy to free patients from ventilatory support and maximise scarce resources.\n COVID-19 provides unique challenges for tracheostomy care: health-care workers need to safely undertake tracheostomy procedures and manage patients afterwards, minimising risks of nosocomial transmission and compromises in the quality of care.\n Conflicting recommendations exist about case selection, the timing and performance of tracheostomy, and the subsequent management of patients.\n In response, we convened an international working group of individuals with relevant expertise in tracheostomy.\n We did a literature and internet search for reports of research pertaining to tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic, supplemented by sources comprising statements and guidance on tracheostomy care.\n By synthesising early experiences from countries that have managed a surge in patient numbers, emerging virological data, and international, multidisciplinary expert opinion, we aim to provide consensus guidelines and recommendations on the conduct and management of tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n","id":"PMC7228735","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Brendan

case study is to evaluate the outcomes of tracheostomy on intubated COVID-19 patients.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>A multicentric prospective observational study of 1890 COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy across 120 hospitals was conducted over 7 weeks in Spain (March 28 to May 15, 2020).\n\n Data were collected with an innovative approach: instant messaging via WhatsApp.\n\n Outcome measurements: complications, achieved weaning and decannulation and survival.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>We performed 1,461 surgical (81.3%) and 429 percutaneous tracheostomies.\n\n Median timing of tracheostomy was 12 days (4–42 days) since orotracheal intubation.\n\n A close follow-up of 1616/1890 (85.5%) patients at the cut-off time of 1-month follow-up showed that in 842 (52.1%) patients,

(ST), and if one PT technique is superior to the others.\n\n\nMethods\nComputerized databases (1966 to 2013) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting complications as predefined endpoints and comparing PT and ST and among the different PT techniques in mechanically ventilated adult critically ill patients.\n\n Odds ratios (OR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI), and I2 values were estimated.\n\n\nResults\nFourteen RCTs tested PT techniques versus ST in 973 patients.\n\n PT techniques were performed faster (MD, ?13.06 minutes (95% CI, ?19.37 to ?6.76 (P &lt;0.0001)); I2?=?97% (P &lt;0.00001)) and reduced odds for stoma inflammation (OR, 0.38 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.76 (P?=?0.006)); I2?=?2% (P?=?0.36)), and infection (OR, 0.22 (95% CI, 0.11 to

health agencies.\n\n The objective of the review was to provide evidence that a.\n\n) demonstrates which otolaryngology procedures are aerosol-generating, and that b.\n\n) clarifies whether the higher level of PPE advocated by otolaryngology groups is justified.\n\n\nMain body\nid='Par2'>Health care workers in China who performed tracheotomy during the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic had 4.15 times greater odds of contracting the virus than controls who did not perform tracheotomy (95% CI 2.75–7.54).\n\n No other studies provide direct epidemiological evidence of increased aerosolized transmission of viruses during otolaryngology procedures.\n\n Experimental evidence has shown that electrocautery, advanced energy devices, open suctioning, and drilling can create aerosolized biological particles.\n\n The viral load of COVID-19 is highest in the upper aerodigestive tract, increasing the likelihood that aerosols generated during procedures of the upper aerodigestive tract of infected patients would carry viral material.\n\n Cough and normal breathing create aerosols which may increase the risk of transmission during outpatient procedures.\n\n A significant proportion of individuals infected with COVID-19 may not have symptoms, raising the likelihood of transmission of the disease to inadequately protected health care workers from patients who do not have probable or

principle, even though the evidence is not definitive, adopting enhanced personal protective equipment protocols is reasonable based on the evidence.\n\n Further research is needed to clarify the risk

underwent bedside tracheotomy from March to April 2020 was conducted to summarize the indications for tracheotomy and key points related to personal protective equipment and surgical procedures.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll 14 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 and were critically ill.\n\n All tracheotomies were performed in the late phase of the infection course.\n\n The interval between the infection and tracheotomy was 33?days, and the median interval between intubation and tracheotomy was 25.5?days.\n\n The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results of secretions from the operative incision and inside the tracheotomy tube were negative.\n\n Twelve patients improved after tracheotomy, with SpO2 levels maintained above 96%.\n\n One patient died of progressive respiratory failure; another patient died of uncontrolled septic shock.\n\n No medical staff who participated in the tracheotomy was infected.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTracheotomy in critically ill patients with COVID-19 who meet the indications for tracheotomy potentially represents a safer approach to manage the airway and help improve the treatment outcomes.\n\n A tracheotomy performed in the late phase of the disease has a relatively low risk of infection.\n\n Adherence to key steps in the tracheotomy procedure and donning adequate personal protection will help medical staff avoid infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7543369","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Surita","surname":"Aodeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Weiqing","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guodong","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Lv","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xin","surname":"Ding","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kaicheng","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sirui","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiazhen","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuyang","surname":"Zhang","email":"talllee@sina.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Gao","email":"talllee@sina.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/0194599820961985","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Tracheostomy

<italic>versus</italic> open surgical technique in severe COVID-19: Complication rates, relative risks and benefits","abstract":"Objective\nPatients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19 have a high likelihood of needing prolonged intubation and may subsequently require tracheotomy.\n\n Usually, the choice of technique (percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy [PDT] versus open surgical tracheotomy [OST]) depends on the preference of surgeons and patient-related factors.\n\n In case of COVID-19, airborne spread of viral particles and limited time of apnea must be considered in the choice of the safest technique.\n\n The aim of this study is to compare the complication rates and offer an assessment of relative risks and benefits of PDT versus OST in patients with severe COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe performed a retrospective study considering 47 consecutive patients affected by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, needing invasive mechanical ventilation and subsequent tracheostomy.\n\n This study was performed at the Intensive Care Unit of our tertiary referral center.\n\n Complication rates were analyzed.\n\n\nResults\nSeventeen patients underwent PDT and 30 patients were submitted to OST.\n\n Twenty-six patients (55.3%) had post-operative complications (local infection, hemorrhage, subcutaneous emphysema) with no significant difference between PDT and OST.\n\n\nConclusion\nPDT and OST are characterized by similar postoperative complication rates in severe COVID-19 patients.\n\n These findings suggest that OST might be preferred if expert ENT surgeons are available, as PDT could result in longer apnea and exposure to generated aerosol.\n\n However, authors recommend considering either OST or PDT at the discretion of the medical staff involved, according to the personal experience of the operators performing the procedure.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7598348","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Cecilia","surname":"Botti","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Francesca","surname":"Lusetti","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommaso","surname":"Neri","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stefano","surname":"Peroni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrea","surname":"Castellucci","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pierpaolo","surname":"Salsi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Angelo","surname":"Ghidini","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.oraloncology.2020.104844","date":"2020-06-02","title":"Systematic

Detection and Viral Load Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in Infected Patients","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency.\n\n The widely used reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) method has limitations for clinical diagnosis and treatment.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 323 samples from 76 COVID-19 confirmed patients were analyzed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and RT-PCR based two target genes (ORF1ab and N).\n\n Nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum, blood, and urine were collected.\n\n Clinical and imaging data were obtained for clinical staging.\n\n\nResults\nIn 95 samples tested positive by both methods, the cycle threshold (Ct) of RT-PCR was highly correlated with the copy numbed of ddPCR (ORF1ab gene, R2 = 0.83; N gene, R2 = 0.87).\n\n 4 (4/161) negative and 41 (41/67) single-gene positive samples tested by RT-PCR were positive according to ddPCR with viral load ranging from 11.1 to 123.2 copies/test.\n\n Then the viral load of respiratory samples was compared and the average viral load in sputum (17429 ± 6920 copies/test) was found to be significantly higher than in throat swabs (2552 ± 1965 copies/test, p &lt; 0.001) and nasal swabs (651 ± 501 copies/test, p &lt; 0.001).\n\n Furthermore, the viral load in the early and progressive stages were significantly higher than that in the recovery stage (46800 ± 17272 vs 1252 ± 1027, p &lt; 0.001) analyzed by sputum samples.\n\n\nConclusions\nQuantitative monitoring of viral load in lower respiratory tract samples helps to evaluate disease progression, especially in cases of low viral load.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184442","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fengting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Liting","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Siyuan","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linghang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yunxia","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guiju","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chengjie","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ruming","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chianru","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lingxiang","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fujie","surname":"Zhang","email":"treatment@chinaaids.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S2213-2600(20)302121-1","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Planning

Independent reviewers screened abstracts using pre-defined criteria, obtained full-text articles, selected relevant studies, and abstracted data.\n Disagreements were resolved by consensus.\n The outcome of interest was risk of ARI transmission.\n The quality of evidence was rated using the GRADE system.\n We identified 5 case-control and 5 retrospective cohort studies which evaluated transmission of SARS to HCWs.\n Procedures reported to present an increased risk of transmission included [n; pooled OR(95%CI)] tracheal intubation [n?=?4 cohort; 6.6 (2.3, 18.9), and n?=?4 case-control; 6.6 (4.1, 10.6)], non-invasive ventilation [n?=?2 cohort; OR 3.1(1.4, 6.8)], tracheotomy [n?=?1 case-control; 4.2 (1.5, 11.5)] and manual ventilation before intubation [n?=?1 cohort; OR 2.8 (1.3, 6.4)].\n Other intubation associated procedures, endotracheal aspiration, suction of body fluids, bronchoscopy, nebulizer treatment, administration of O2, high flow O2, manipulation of O2 mask or BiPAP mask, defibrillation, chest compressions, insertion of nasogastric tube, and collection of sputum were not significant.\n Our findings suggest that some procedures potentially capable of generating aerosols have been associated with increased risk of SARS transmission to HCWs or were a risk factor for transmission, with the most consistent association across multiple studies identified with tracheal intubation.\n","id":"PMC3338532","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Khai","surname":"Tran","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Karen","surname":"Cimon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Melissa","surname":"Severn","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Carmem

care workers’ skin and clothing during removal of personal protective equipment","abstract":"Background\nThe removal of personal protective equipment (PPE) after patient care may result in transfer of virus to hands and clothing of health care workers (HCWs).\n\n The risk of transfer can be modeled using harmless viruses to obtain quantitative data.\n\n To determine whether double-gloving reduces virus transfer to HCWs’ hands and clothing during removal of contaminated PPE, we conducted a human challenge study using bacteriophages to compare the frequency and quantity of virus transfer to hands and clothes during PPE removal with single-gloving and double-gloving technique.\n\n\nMethods\nEach experiment had a double-gloving phase and a single-gloving phase.\n\n Participants donned PPE (ie, contact isolation gown, N95 respirator, eye protection, latex gloves).\n\n The gown, respirator, eye protection, and dominant glove were contaminated with bacteriophage.\n\n Participants then removed the PPE, and their hands, face, and scrubs were sampled for virus.\n\n\nResults\nTransfer of virus to hands during PPE removal was significantly more frequent with single-gloving than with double-gloving.\n\n Transfer to scrubs was similar during single-gloving and double-gloving.\n\n The amount of virus transfer to hands ranged from 0.15 to 2.5 log10 most probable number.\n\n Significantly more virus was transferred to participants’ hands after single-gloving than after double-gloving.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur comparison of double-gloving and single-gloving using a simulation system with MS2 and a most-probable number method suggests that double gloving can reduce the risk of viral contamination of HCWs’ hands during PPE removal.\n\n If incorporated into practice when full PPE is worn, this practice may reduce the risk of viral contamination of HCWs’ hands during PPE removal.\n\n The use of double gloves should be explored in larger controlled studies.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7115263","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lisa M.","surname":"Casanova","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"William

remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 173 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled.\n\n Their serial plasma samples (n=535) collected during the hospitalization were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of antibodies with the disease progress was analyzed.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1%, 82.7% and 64.7%, respectively.\n\n The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness.\n\n The median seroconversion time for Ab, IgM and then IgG were day-11, day-12 and day-14, separately.\n\n The presence of antibodies was &lt;40% among patients within 1-week since onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0% (Ab), 94.3% (IgM) and 79.8% (IgG) since day-15 after onset.\n\n In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day-7 to 45.5% (25/55) during day 15-39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (p&lt;0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p=0.007).\n\n Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p=0.006).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of

During the next two months, it moved rapidly throughout China.\n Most of the infected patients have mild symptoms including fever, fatigue and cough, but in severe cases, patients can progress rapidly and develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.\n The new coronavirus was reported to spread via droplets, contact and natural aerosols from human to human.\n Therefore, aerosol-producing procedures such as endotracheal intubation may put the anesthesiologists at high risk of nosocomial infections.\n In fact, SARS-CoV-2 infection of anesthesiologists after endotracheal intubation for confirmed COVID-19 patients have been reported in hospitals in Wuhan.\n The expert panel of airway management in Chinese Society of Anaesthesiology has deliberated and drafted this recommendation, by which we hope to guide the performance of endotracheal intubation by frontline anesthesiologists and critical care physicians.\n During the airway management, enhanced droplet/airborne personal protective equitment (PPE) should be applied to the health care providers.\n A good airway assessment before airway intervention is of vital importance.\n For patients with normal airway, awake intubation should be avoided, and modified rapid sequence induction is strongly recommended.\n Sufficient muscle relaxant should be assured before intubation.\n For patients with difficult airway, good preparation of airway devices and detailed intubation plans should be made.\n","id":"PMC7367670","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mingzhang","surname":"Zuo","email":"zuomz@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuguang","surname":"Huang","email":"garybeijing@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wuhua","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhanggang","surname":"Xue","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiaqiang","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yahong","surname":"Gong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Che","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamaoto.2020.0488","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Practical aspects of otolaryngologic clinical services during the 2019 novel coronavirus epidemic: an experience in Hong Kong","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"In vitro evaluation of heat and moisture exchangers designed for spontaneously breathing tracheostomized patients","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Above cuff vocalisation: a novel technique for communication in the ventilator-dependent tracheostomy patient","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Communicating with conscious and mechanically ventilated critically ill patients: a systematic review","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"10.1111/anae.15120","date":"2020-05-10","title":"Multidisciplinary guidance for safe tracheostomy care during the COVID?19 pandemic: the NHS National Patient Safety Improvement Programme (NatPatSIP)","abstract":"The COVID?19 pandemic is causing a significant increase in the number of patients requiring relatively prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation and an associated surge in patients who need a tracheostomy to facilitate weaning from respiratory support.\n In parallel, there has been a global increase in guidance from professional bodies representing staff who care for patients with tracheostomies at different points in their acute hospital journey, rehabilitation and recovery.\n Of concern are the risks to healthcare staff of infection arising from tracheostomy insertion and caring for patients with a tracheostomy.\n Hospitals are also facing extraordinary demands on critical care services such that many patients who require a tracheostomy will be managed outside established intensive care or head and neck units and cared for by staff with little tracheostomy experience.\n These concerns led NHS England and NHS Improvement to expedite the National Patient Safety Improvement Programme’s ‘Safe Tracheostomy Care’ workstream as part of the NHS COVID?19 response.\n Supporting this workstream, UK stakeholder organisations involved in tracheostomy care were invited to develop consensus guidance based on: expert opinion; the best available published literature; and existing multidisciplinary guidelines.\n Topics with direct relevance for frontline staff were identified.\n This consensus guidance includes: infectivity of patients with respect to tracheostomy indications and timing;

SARS-CoV-2 in patients of novel coronavirus disease 2019","abstract":"Background\nThe novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging virus.\n\n The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 173 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled.\n\n Their serial plasma samples (n=535) collected during the hospitalization were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of antibodies with the disease progress was analyzed.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1%, 82.7% and 64.7%, respectively.\n\n The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness.\n\n The median seroconversion time for Ab, IgM and then IgG were day-11, day-12 and day-14, separately.\n\n The presence of antibodies was &lt;40% among patients within 1-week since onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0% (Ab), 94.3% (IgM) and 79.8% (IgG) since day-15 after onset.\n\n In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day-7 to 45.5% (25/55) during day 15-39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (p&lt;0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p=0.007).\n\n Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p=0.006).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184337","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Juanjuan","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Quan","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Haiyan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuejiao","surname":"Liao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yingying","surname":"Su","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tingdong","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinxiu","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shen","surname":"Qian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Congming","surname":"Hong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fuxiang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yingxia","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoqin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiyong","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tianying","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Fu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shengxiang","surname":"Ge","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ningshao","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangzheng1975@aliyun.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Viral

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future

pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle

Primary articles were identified by English-language Pubmed/MEDLINE, Cochrane central register of controlled trials, and Cochrane systemic review database search (1960–June 2009) using the MeSH headings: ARDS, adult respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS, corticosteroids, and methylprednisolone (MP).\n The identified studies were reviewed and information regarding role of corticosteroids in prevention and treatment of ARDS was evaluated.\n Nine trials have evaluated the role of corticosteroid drugs in management of ARDS at various stages.\n Of the 9, 4 trials evaluated role of corticosteroids in prevention of ARDS, while other 5 trials were focused on treatment after variable periods of onset of ARDS.\n Trials with preventive corticosteroids, mostly using high doses of MP, showed negative results with patients in treatment arm, showing higher mortality and rate of ARDS development.\n While trials of corticosteroids in early ARDS showed variable results, somewhat, favoring use of these agents to reduce associated morbidities.\n In late stage of ARDS, these drugs have no benefits and are associated with adverse outcome.\n Use of corticosteroids in patients with early ARDS showed equivocal results in decreasing mortality; however, there is evidence that these drugs reduce organ dysfunction score, lung injury score, ventilator requirement, and intensive care unit stay.\n However, most of these trials are small, having a significant heterogeneity regarding study design, etiology of ARDS, and dosage of corticosteroids.\n Further research involving large-scale trials on relatively homogeneous cohort is necessary to establish the role of corticosteroids for this

possible to progress in the optimization of the fluid state during ARDS.\n Notably, a randomized, multicenter study has suggested that fluid management with the goal to obtain zero fluid balance in ARDS patients without shock or renal failure significantly increases the number of days without mechanical ventilation.\n On the other hand, it is accepted that patients with hemodynamic failure must undergo early and adapted vascular filling.\n Liberal and conservative filling strategies are therefore complementary and should ideally follow each other in time in the same patient whose hemodynamic state progressively stabilizes.\n At present, although albumin treatment has been suggested to improve oxygenation transiently in ARDS patients, no sufficient evidence justifies its use to mitigate pulmonary edema and reduce respiratory morbidity.\n Finally, the resorption of alveolar edema occurs through an active mechanism, which can be pharmacologically upregluated.\n In this sense, the use of beta-2 agonists may be beneficial but further studies are needed to confirm preliminary promising results.\n","id":"PMC3224488","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Antoine","surname":"Roch","email":"antoine.roch@ap-hm.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christophe","surname":"Guervilly","email":"christophe.guervilly@ap-hm.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laurent","surname":"Papazian","email":"laurent.papazian@ap-hm.fr","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A
