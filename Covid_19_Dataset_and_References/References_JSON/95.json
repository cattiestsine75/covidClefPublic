Changes and Body Mass Index during COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown: An Italian Online-Survey","abstract":"Background.\n\n COVID-19 pandemic has imposed a period of contingency measures, including total or partial lockdowns all over the world leading to several changes in lifestyle/eating behaviours.\n\n This retrospective cohort study aimed at investigating Italian adult population lifestyle changes during COVID-19 pandemic “Phase 1” lockdown (8 March–4 May 2020) and discriminate between positive and negative changes and BMI (body mass index) variations (?BMI).\n\n Methods.\n\n A multiple-choice web-form survey was used to collect retrospective data regarding lifestyle/eating behaviours during “Phase 1” in the Italian adult population.\n\n According to changes in lifestyle/eating behaviours, the sample was divided into three classes of changes: “negative change”, “no change”, “positive change”.\n\n For each class, correlations with ?BMI were investigated.\n\n Results.\n\n Data were collected from 1304 subjects (973F/331M).\n\n Mean ?BMI differed significantly (p &lt; 0.001) between classes, and was significantly related to water intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, frequency of “craving or snacking between meals”, dessert/sweets consumption at lunch.\n\n Conclusions.\n\n During “Phase 1”, many people faced several negative changes in lifestyle/eating behaviours with potential negative impact on health.\n\n These findings highlight that pandemic exacerbates nutritional issues and most efforts need to be done to provide nutrition counselling and public health services to support general population needs.\n\n","id":"PMC8066204","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Silvia","surname":"Maffoni","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

Glycemic control is important factor in preventing the complications associated with diabetes.\n\n Pillars for good glycemic control are good life style modification with proper medication under

407 only 143 diabetic patients who attended the our endocrine OPD in last 3 months who had good glycemic control in past without any chronic complication and willing to participate were included in

Policies During the COVID-19 Pandemic on Health and Well-Being Among Australian Adolescents","abstract":"Purpose\nPhysical distancing policies in the state of New South Wales (Australia) were implemented on March 23, 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n This study investigated changes in physical activity, dietary behaviors, and well-being during the early period of this policy.\n\n\nMethods\nA cohort of young people aged 13–19 years from Sydney (N = 582) were prospectively followed for 22 weeks (November 18, 2019, to April 19, 2020).\n\n Daily, weekly, and monthly trajectories of diet, physical activity, sedentary behavior, well-being, and psychological distress were collected via smartphone, using a series of ecological momentary assessments and smartphone sensors.\n\n Differences in health and well-being outcomes were compared pre- and post-implementation of physical distancing guidelines.\n\n\nResults\nAfter the implementation of physical distancing measures in NSW, there were significant decreases in physical activity (odds ratio [OR] = .\n\n53, 95% confidence interval [CI] = .\n\n34–.\n\n83), increases in social media and Internet use (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.15–3.00), and increased screen time based on participants' smartphone screen state.\n\n Physical distancing measures were also associated with being alone in the previous hour (OR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.33–3.28), decreases in happiness (OR = .\n\n38, 95% CI = .\n\n18–.\n\n82), and fast food consumption (OR = .\n\n46, 95% CI = .\n\n29–.\n\n73).\n\n\nConclusions\nPhysical distancing and social restrictions had a contemporaneous impact on health and well-being outcomes associated with chronic disease among young people.\n\n As the pandemic evolves, it will be important to consider how to mitigate against any longer term health impacts of physical distancing restrictions.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7577185","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sithum","surname":"Munasinghe","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"
