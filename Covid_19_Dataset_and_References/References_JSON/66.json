self-designed questionnaire, which consisted of a basic information form, self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).\n Descriptive analysis, single factor analysis and correlation analysis were used to analyze the current status of the interns' psychology and sleep quality, the potential factors affecting their psychology and sleep quality, and the correlation between their psychological status and sleep quality.\n RESULTS The surveyed interns had SAS, SDS and PSQI score of 37.79±6.59, 43.98±9.74 and 5.20±3.14,

began in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and spread rapidly to the whole country within 1 month.\n\n This new epidemic caused a great mental reaction among the public.\n\n This study aimed to assess and compare the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety and depression among the public affected by quarantine and those unaffected during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb.\n\n 2020.\nMaterial/Methods\nData were collected using the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and the self-rating depression scale (SDS) administered to 1593 respondents aged 18 years and above.\n\n The respondents were grouped as ‘affected group’ and ‘unaffected group’ on the basis of whether they or their families/colleagues/classmates/neighbors had been quarantined.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 1593 participants, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was approximately 8.3% and 14.6%, respectively, and the prevalence in the affected group (12.9%, 22.4%) was significantly higher than that in the unaffected group (6.7%, 11.9%).\n\n Lower average household income, lower education level, having a higher self-evaluated level of knowledge, being more worried about being infected, having no psychological support, greater property damage, and lower self-perceived health condition were significant associated with higher scores on the SAS and SDS.\n\n People living in Chongqing had higher SAS and SDS scores than those living in Yunnan Province.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe prevalence of anxiety and depression of the affected group are higher than in the unaffected group during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb.\n\n 2020. The government should focus more on providing economic and medical support to improve the general population’s mental

the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Hubei Province, China, was at its height, requiring isolation of the population.\n\n This study aimed to compare the emotional state, somatic responses, sleep quality, and behavior of people in Hubei Province with non-endemic provinces in China during two weeks in February 2020.\nMaterial/Methods\nQuestionnaires were completed by 939 individuals (357 men; 582 women), including 33 from Hubei and 906 from non-endemic provinces.\n\n The Stress Response Questionnaire (SRQ) determined the emotional state, somatic responses, and

25–39 years (35.57%); 65.92% were university students.\n\n During a two week period in February 2020, the emotional state and behavior of participants in Hubei improved, but the quality of sleep did not.\n\n Health workers and business people became increasingly anxious, but other professionals became less anxious.\n\n The data showed that most people in Hubei Province developed a more positive

less anxious about the COVID-19 epidemic, but sleep quality did not improve.\n\n Despite public awareness, levels of anxiety exist that affect the quality of life during epidemics, including periods of population quarantine.\n\n Therefore, health education should be combined with psychological counseling for vulnerable
