A total of 996 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled, including 282 patients with hypertension and 714 patients without hypertension.\n Propensity score-matched analysis (1:1 matching) was used to adjust the imbalanced baseline variables between the 2 groups.\n Patients with hypertension were further divided into the RAAS inhibitor group (n=41) and non-RAAS inhibitor group (n=241) according to their medication history.\n The results showed that COVID-19 patients with hypertension had more severe secondary infections, cardiac and renal dysfunction, and depletion of CD8\n+\ncells on admission.\n Patients with hypertension were more likely to have comorbidities and complications and were more likely to be classified as critically ill than those without hypertension.\n Cox regression analysis revealed that hypertension (hazard ratio, 95% CI, unmatched cohort [1.80, 1.20\u20132.70]; matched cohort [2.24, 1.36\u20133.70]) was independently associated with all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19. In addition, hypertensive patients with a history of RAAS inhibitor treatment had lower levels of C-reactive protein and higher levels of CD4\n+\ncells.\n The mortality of patients in the RAAS inhibitor group (9.8% versus 26.1%) was significantly lower than that of patients in the non-RAAS inhibitor group.\n In conclusion, hypertension may be an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19. Patients who previously used RAAS inhibitors may have a better prognosis.\n\n","id":"10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.120.15289","idformat":"CROSSREF","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"PUBLISHER: Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health)","authors":[{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Pan","email":"xref no email","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jishou","surname":"Zhang","email":"xref no email","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Menglong","surname":"Wang","email":"xref no email","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jing","surname":"Ye","email":"xref no email","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yao","surname":"Xu","email":"xref no email","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Bo","surname":"Shen","email":"xref no email","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Hua","surname":"He","email":"xref no email","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Zhen","surname":"Wang","email":"xref no email","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Di","surname":"Ye","email":"xref no email","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Mengmeng","surname":"Zhao","email":"xref no email","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Zhen","surname":"Luo","email":"xref no email","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Mingxiao","surname":"Liu","email":"xref no email","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Pingan","surname":"Zhang","email":"xref no email","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jian","surname":"Gu","email":"xref no email","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Menglin","surname":"Liu","email":"xref no email","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Dan","surname":"Li","email":"xref no email","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jianfang","surname":"Liu","email":"xref no email","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"       Jun","surname":"Wan","email":"xref no email","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1161/JAHA.120.016948","date":"2020-07-01","title":"Could Anti?Hypertensive Drug Therapy Affect the Clinical Prognosis of Hypertensive Patients With COVID?19 Infection? Data From Centers of Southern Italy","abstract":"BACKGROUND\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) is the cause of a pandemic disease, with severe acute respiratory syndrome by binding target epithelial lung cells through angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 in humans.\n\n Thus, patients with hypertension with COVID?19 could have worse prognosis.\n\n Indeed, angiotensin?converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers may interfere with angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 expression/activity.\n\n Thus, patients with hypertension undergoing angiotensin?converting enzyme inhibitor and/or angiotensin receptor blockers drug therapy may be at a higher risk of contracting a serious COVID?19 infection and should be monitored.\n\n Moreover, in the present study we investigated the effects of angiotensin?converting enzyme inhibitor versus angiotensin receptor blockers versus calcium channel blockers on clinical outcomes as mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admissions, heart injury, and death in 62 patients with hypertension hospitalized for COVID?19 infection.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThe multicenter study was prospectively conducted at Department of Infectious Diseases of Sant'Anna Hospital of Caserta, and of University of Campania 'Luigi Vanvitelli' of Naples, at Department of Advanced Surgical and Medical Sciences of University of Campania 'Luigi Vanvitelli,' Naples, and at General Medical Assistance Unit 'FIMG,' Naples, Italy.\n\n Lowest values of left ventricle ejection fraction predicted deaths (1.142, 1.008–1.294, P&lt;0.05), while highest values of interleukin?6 predicted the admission to intensive care unit (1.617, 1.094–2.389), mechanical ventilation (1.149, 1.082–1.219), heart injuries (1.367, 1.054–1.772), and deaths (4.742, 1.788–8.524).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAnti?hypertensive drugs didn't affect the prognosis in patients with COVID?19. Consequently, tailored anti?inflammatory and immune therapies in addition to chronic antihypertensive therapy, could prevent a worse prognosis, as well as improve the clinical outcomes in patients with hypertension with COVID?19

consequences of using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) during the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown.\n\n\nMethods:\nA retrospective cohort study aiming to identify the odds of severe disease (defined as either hospitalization of ?14 days, admission to the intensive care unit, or death) associated with exposure to ACEi or ARB was conducted.\n\n Adult patients (age ?18 years) with COVID-19 admitted to the ?stanbul Faculty of Medicine Corona Center between March 9 and May 11, 2020, were included.\n\n Chronic users of ACEi, ARB, or other antihypertensive drugs were matched according to age, sex, sick days before hospitalization, comorbidities, smoking, number of antihypertensive regimens, doxazosin use, furosemide use, and serum creatinine level.\n\n Odds ratios (OR) of having severe disease were calculated.\n\n\nResults:\nIn total, 611 patients were admitted with COVID-19, confirmed by either reverse-transcriptase polymerase
