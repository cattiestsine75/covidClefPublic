The final date of follow up was 5 May 2020.\nMain outcome measures\nOutcomes were admission to hospital, critical illness (intensive care, mechanical ventilation, discharge to hospice care, or death), and discharge to hospice care or death.\n\n Predictors included patient characteristics, medical history, vital signs, and laboratory results.\n\n Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes, and competing risk survival analysis for mortality.\n\n\nResults\nOf 11?544 people tested for SARS-Cov-2, 5566 (48.2%) were positive.\n\n After exclusions, 5279 were included.\n\n 2741 of these 5279 (51.9%) were admitted to hospital, of whom 1904 (69.5%) were discharged alive without hospice care and 665 (24.3%) were discharged to hospice care or died.\n\n Of 647 (23.6%) patients requiring mechanical ventilation, 391 (60.4%) died and 170 (26.2%) were extubated or discharged.\n\n The strongest risk for hospital admission was associated with age, with an odds ratio of &gt;2 for all age groups older than 44 years and 37.9 (95% confidence interval 26.1 to 56.0) for ages 75 years and older.\n\n Other risks were heart failure (4.4, 2.6 to 8.0), male sex (2.8, 2.4 to 3.2), chronic kidney disease (2.6, 1.9 to 3.6), and any increase in body mass index (BMI) (eg, for BMI &gt;40: 2.5, 1.8 to 3.4).\n\n The strongest risks for critical illness besides age were associated with heart failure (1.9, 1.4 to 2.5), BMI &gt;40 (1.5, 1.0 to 2.2), and male sex (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8).\n\n Admission oxygen saturation of &lt;88% (3.7, 2.8 to 4.8), troponin level &gt;1 (4.8, 2.1 to 10.9), C reactive protein level &gt;200 (5.1, 2.8 to 9.2), and D-dimer level &gt;2500 (3.9, 2.6 to 6.0) were, however, more strongly associated with critical illness than age or comorbidities.\n\n Risk of critical illness decreased significantly over the study period.\n\n Similar associations were found for mortality alone.\n\n\nConclusions\nAge and comorbidities were found to be strong predictors of hospital admission and to a lesser extent of critical illness and mortality in people with covid-19;

admitted patients to the Radboud university medical centre nursing ward for COVID-19. Laboratory assessment included high-sensitivity Troponin T and N?terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP).\n\n Echocardiographic evaluation focused on left and right ventricular systolic function and global longitudinal strain (GLS).\n\n\nResults\nIn total, 51 patients were included, with a median age of 63 years (range 51–68 years) of whom 80% was male.\n\n Troponin T was elevated (&gt;14?ng/l) in 47%, and a clinically relevant Troponin T elevation (10?×?URL) was found in three patients (6%).\n\n NT-proBNP was elevated (&gt;300?pg/ml) in 24 patients (47%), and in four (8%) the NT-proBNP concentration was &gt;1,000?pg/ml.\n\n Left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction &lt;52% and/or GLS &gt;?18%) was observed in 27%, while right ventricular dysfunction (TAPSE &lt;17?mm and/or RV S’?&lt;?10?cm/s) was seen in 10%.\n\n There was no association between elevated Troponin T or NT-proBNP and left or right ventricular dysfunction.\n\n Patients with confirmed pulmonary embolism had normal right ventricular function.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalised patients, it seems that COVID-19 predominantly affects the respiratory system, while cardiac dysfunction occurs less often.\n\n Based on a single echocardiographic evaluation, we found no relation between elevated Troponin T or NT-proBNP, and ventricular dysfunction.\n\n Echocardiography has limited value in screening for ventricular dysfunction.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s12471-020-01458-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7341471","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_Springer_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"F.

myocytes and increase arrhythmia risk.\n\n\nObjectives\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk of cardiac arrest and arrhythmias including incident atrial fibrillation (AF), bradyarrhythmias, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) in a large urban population hospitalized for COVID-19. We also evaluated correlations between the presence of these arrhythmias and mortality.\n\n\nMethods\nWe reviewed the characteristics of all patients with COVID-19 admitted to our center over a 9-week period.\n\n Throughout hospitalization, we evaluated the incidence of cardiac arrests, arrhythmias, and inpatient mortality.\n\n We also used logistic regression to evaluate age, sex, race, body mass index, prevalent cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and intensive care unit (ICU) status as potential risk factors for each arrhythmia.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 700 patients (mean age 50 ± 18 years; 45% men; 71% African American; 11% received ICU care), there were 9 cardiac arrests, 25 incident AF events, 9 clinically significant bradyarrhythmias, and 10 NSVTs.\n\n All cardiac arrests occurred in patients admitted to the ICU.\n\n In addition, admission to the ICU was associated with incident AF (odds ratio [OR] 4.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.66–13.18) and NSVT (OR 8.92; 95% CI 1.73–46.06) after multivariable adjustment.\n\n Also, age and incident AF (OR 1.05; 95% CI 1.02–1.09) and prevalent heart failure and bradyarrhythmias (OR 9.75; 95% CI 1.95–48.65) were independently associated.\n\n Only cardiac arrests were associated with acute in-hospital mortality.\n\n\nConclusion\nCardiac arrests and arrhythmias are likely the consequence of systemic illness and not solely the direct effects of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7307518","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Anjali","surname":"Bhatla","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Michael M.","surname":"Mayer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Srinath","surname":"Adusumalli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Matthew C.","surname":"Hyman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Eric","surname":"Oh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Ann","surname":"Tierney","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Juwann","surname":"Moss","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Anwar A.","surname":"Chahal","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" George","surname":"Anesi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Srinivas","surname":"Denduluri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Christopher M.","surname":"Domenico","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Jeffrey","surname":"Arkles","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Benjamin S.","surname":"Abella","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" John R.","surname":"Bullinga","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" David J.","surname":"Callans","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Sanjay","surname":"Dixit","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Andrew E.","surname":"Epstein","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" David S.","surname":"Frankel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Fermin C.","surname":"Garcia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Ramanan","surname":"Kumareswaram","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Saman","surname":"Nazarian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Michael P.","surname":"Riley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Pasquale","surname":"Santangeli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Robert D.","surname":"Schaller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Gregory E.","surname":"Supple","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" David","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Francis","surname":"Marchlinski","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                           Rajat","surname":"Deo","email":"Rajat.Deo@pennmedicine.upenn.edu","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2004500","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Covid-19 in Critically Ill Patients in the Seattle Region — Case Series","abstract":"Background\nCommunity transmission of coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) was detected in the state of Washington in February 2020.\nMethods\nWe identified patients from nine Seattle-area hospitals who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Clinical data were obtained through review of medical records.\n\n The data reported here are those available through March 23, 2020.
