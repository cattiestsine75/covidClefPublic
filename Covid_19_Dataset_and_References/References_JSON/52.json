wards for patients with COVID-19 in multiple regions of China, a considerable proportion of health care workers reported experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress, especially women, nurses, those in Wuhan, and front-line health care workers directly engaged in diagnosing, treating, or providing nursing care to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.\nMeaning\nThese findings suggest that, among Chinese health care workers exposed to COVID-19, women, nurses, those in Wuhan, and front-line health care workers have a high risk of developing

cross-sectional survey","abstract":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2 virus) has been sustained in China since December 2019, and has become a pandemic.\n\n The mental health of frontline medical staff is a concern.\n\n In this study, we aimed to identify the factors influencing medical worker anxiety in China during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n We conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of anxiety among medical staff in China from 10 February 2020 to 20 February 2020 using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) to assess anxiety, with the criteria of normal (?49), mild (50–59), moderate (60–70) and severe anxiety (?70).\n\n We used multivariable linear regression to determine the factors (e.\n\ng.\n\n having direct contact when treating infected patients, being a medical staff worker from Hubei province, being a suspect case) for anxiety.\n\n We also used adjusted models to confirm independent factors for anxiety after adjusting for gender, age, education and marital status.\n\n Of 512 medical staff in China, 164 (32.03%) had had direct contact treating infected patients.\n\n The prevalence of anxiety was 12.5%, with 53 workers suffering from mild (10.35%), seven workers suffering from moderate (1.36%) and four workers suffering from severe anxiety (0.78%).\n\n After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, education and marital status), medical staff who had had direct contact treating infected patients experienced higher anxiety scores than those who had not had direct contact (? value = 2.33, confidence interval (CI) 0.65–4.00; P = 0.0068).\n\n A similar trend was observed in medical staff from Hubei province, compared with those from other parts of China (? value = 3.67, CI 1.44–5.89; P = 0.0013).\n\n The most important variable was suspect cases with high anxiety scores, compared to non-suspect cases (? value = 4.44, CI 1.55–7.33; P = 0.0028).\n\n In this survey of hospital medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, we found that study participants experienced anxiety symptoms, especially those who had direct clinical contact with infected patients; as did those in the worst affected areas, including Hubei province; and those who were suspect cases.\n\n Governments and healthcare authorities should proactively implement appropriate psychological intervention programmes, to prevent, alleviate or treat increased anxiety.\n\n","id":"PMC7251286","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chen-Yun","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"

using a self-designed questionnaire, which consisted of a basic information form, self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).\n Descriptive analysis, single factor analysis and correlation analysis were used to analyze the current status of the interns' psychology and sleep quality, the potential factors affecting their

psychological morbidities that can be used as psychological intervention targets.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted to investigate the psychological levels of HCW in multiple

psychological pressure on Chinese medical staff.\n\n It is extremely important to understand the prevalence and influencing factors of anxiety and depression symptoms in first-line anti-epidemic medical staff and their coping styles for these negative emotions.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted in Gansu (China), with a questionnaire packet which consisted of the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and the simplified coping style questionnaire (SCSQ).\n\n A total of 79 doctors and 86 nurses participated in the survey.\n\n Correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationship between SAS, SDS, and SCSQ score.\n\n A linear regression model was used to determine the influencing factors for anxiety or depression symptoms.\n\n\nResults\nThe prevalence rates of anxiety and depression symptoms among doctors was 11.4% and 45.6%, respectively.\n\n History of depression or anxiety (T=-2.644, p= 0.010, 95%CI: -10.514~-1.481) was shown to be a risk factor for anxiety symptoms in doctors, while being male (T=2.970, p=0.004, 95%CI: 2.667~13.521) was a protective factor for depression.\n\n The prevalence rate of anxiety and depression symptoms among nurses was 27.9% and 43.0%, respectively.\n\n History of depression or anxiety was a common risk factor for anxiety symptoms (T=-3.635, p=0.000, 95%CI: -16.360~-4.789) and depression symptoms (T=-2.835, p=0.005, 95%CI:-18.238~-3.254) in nurses.\n\n The results of partial correlation analysis (controlled for gender and history of depression or anxiety) indicated that the total score of positive coping was negatively correlated with the total score of anxiety (r=-0.182, p=0.002) and depression (r=-0.253, p=0.001).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe first-line anti-epidemic medical staff have high anxiety and depression symptoms and adopting positive coping styles will help to improve their negative

history of chronic disease were at higher risk of developing depression.\n\n Females, divorced participants among the general population, and university students with history of chronic disease and those with high income (?1,500 JD) were at higher risk of developing anxiety.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring outbreaks, individuals are put under extreme stressful condition resulting in higher risk of developing anxiety and depression particularly for students and healthcare professionals.\n\n Policymakers and mental healthcare providers are advised to provide further mental support to these vulnerable groups during this pandemic.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7361060","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Abdallah

and burnout","abstract":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put considerable physical and emotional strain on frontline healthcare workers.\n\n Among frontline healthcare workers, physician trainees represent a unique group—functioning simultaneously as both learners and caregivers and experiencing considerable challenges during the pandemic.\n\n However, we have a limited understanding regarding the emotional effects and vulnerability experienced by trainees during the pandemic.\n\n We investigated the effects of trainee exposure to patients being tested for COVID-19 on their depression, anxiety, stress, burnout and professional fulfillment.\n\n All physician trainees at an academic medical center (n = 1375) were invited to participate in an online survey.\n\n We compared the measures of depression, anxiety, stress, burnout and professional fulfillment among trainees who were exposed to patients being tested for COVID-19 and those that were not, using univariable and multivariable models.\n\n We also evaluated perceived life stressors such as childcare, home schooling, personal finances and work-family balance among both groups.\n\n 393 trainees completed the survey (29% response rate).\n\n Compared to the non-exposed group, the exposed group had a higher prevalence of stress (29.4% vs.\n\n 18.9%), and burnout (46.3% vs.\n\n 33.7%).\n\n The exposed group also experienced moderate to extremely high perceived stress regarding childcare and had a lower work-family balance.\n\n Multivariable models indicated that trainees who were exposed to COVID-19 patients reported significantly higher stress (10.96 [95% CI, 9.65 to 12.46] vs 8.44 [95% CI, 7.3 to 9.76]; P = 0.043) and were more likely to be burned out (1.31 [95% CI, 1.21 to1.41] vs 1.07 [95% CI, 0.96 to 1.19]; P = 0.002].\n\n We also found that female trainees were more likely to be stressed (P = 0.043); while unmarried trainees were more likely to be depressed (P = 0.009), and marginally more likely to have anxiety (P = 0.051).\n\n To address these challenges, wellness programs should focus on sustaining current programs, develop new and targeted mental health resources that are widely accessible and devise strategies for creating awareness regarding these resources.\n\n","id":"PMC7410237","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Thomas
