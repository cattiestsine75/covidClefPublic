This interaction has been proposed as a potential risk factor in patients treated with RAAS inhibitors.\n\n\nObjectives\nThis study analyzed whether RAAS inhibitors modify the risk for COVID-19.\nMethods\nThe RASTAVI (Renin-Angiotensin System Blockade Benefits in Clinical Evolution and Ventricular Remodeling After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) trial is an ongoing randomized clinical trial randomly allocating subjects to ramipril or control groups after successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement at 14 centers in Spain.\n\n A non-pre-specified interim analysis was performed to evaluate ramipril’s impact on COVID-19 risk in this vulnerable population.\n\n\nResults\nAs of April 1, 2020, 102 patients (50 in the ramipril group and 52 in the control group) were included in the trial.\n\n Mean age was 82.3 ± 6.1 years, 56.9% of the participants were male.\n\n Median time of ramipril treatment was 6 months (interquartile range: 2.9 to 11.4 months).\n\n Eleven patients (10.8%) have been diagnosed with COVID-19 (6 in control group and 5 receiving ramipril; hazard ratio: 1.150; 95% confidence interval: 0.351 to 3.768).\n\n The risk of COVID-19 was increased in older patients (p = 0.019) and those with atrial fibrillation (p = 0.066), lower hematocrit (p = 0.084), and more comorbidities according to Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (p = 0.065).\n\n Admission and oxygen supply was required in 4.9% of patients (2 in the ramipril group and 3 in the control group), and 4 of them died (2 in each randomized group).\n\n A higher body mass index was the only factor increasing the mortality rate (p = 0.039).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn a high-risk population of older patients with cardiovascular disease, randomization to ramipril had no impact on the incidence or severity of COVID-19. This analysis supports the maintenance of RAAS inhibitor treatment during the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n (Renin-Angiotensin System Blockade Benefits in Clinical Evolution and Ventricular Remodeling After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation [RASTAVI]; NCT03201185)\n","id":"PMC7250557","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ignacio J.","surname":"Amat-Santos","email":"ijamat@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Sandra","surname":"Santos-Martinez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Diego","surname":"López-Otero","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Luis","surname":"Nombela-Franco","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Enrique","surname":"Gutiérrez-Ibanes","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Raquel","surname":"Del Valle","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Erika","surname":"Muñoz-García","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Víctor A.","surname":"Jiménez-Diaz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Ander","surname":"Regueiro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Rocío","surname":"González-Ferreiro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Tomás","surname":"Benito","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Xoan Carlos","surname":"Sanmartin-Pena","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Pablo","surname":"Catalá","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Tania","surname":"Rodríguez-Gabella","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Jose Raúl","surname":"Delgado-Arana","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Manuel","surname":"Carrasco-Moraleja","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Borja","surname":"Ibañez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                               J.

Since previous reports suggested that viral entry into cells may involve angiotensin converting enzyme 2, there has been growing concern that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) use may exacerbate the disease severity.\n\n In this retrospective, single-center US study of adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19, we evaluated the association of ACEI/ARB use with hospital admission.\n\n Secondary outcomes included: ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, use of inotropes, and all-cause mortality.\n\n Propensity score matching was performed to account for potential confounders.\n\n Among 590 unmatched patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 78 patients were receiving ACEI/ARB (median age 63 years and 59.7% male) and 512 patients were non-users (median age 42 years and 47.1% male).\n\n In the propensity matched population, multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities demonstrated that ACEI/ARB use was not associated with hospital admission (OR 1.2, 95%CI 0.5 to 2.7, p?=?0.652).\n\n CAD and CKD/end stage renal disease [ESRD] remained independently associated with admission to hospital.\n\n All-cause mortality, ICU stay, need for ventilation, and inotrope use was not significantly different between the 2 study groups.\n\n In conclusion, among patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19, ACEI/ARB use was not associated with increased risk of hospital

The hospital was dedicated solely to the treatment of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.\n\n Hypertension and the treatments were stratified according to the medical history or medications administrated prior to the infection.\n\n Among 2877 hospitalized patients, 29.5% (850/2877) had a history of hypertension.\n\n After adjustment for confounders, patients with hypertension had a two-fold increase in the relative risk of mortality as compared with patients without hypertension [4.0% vs.\n\n 1.1%, adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 2.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17–3.82, P = 0.013].\n\n Patients with a

antihypertensive drugs were matched according to age, sex, sick days before hospitalization, comorbidities, smoking, number of antihypertensive regimens, doxazosin use, furosemide use, and serum creatinine level.\n\n Odds ratios (OR) of having severe disease were calculated.\n\n\nResults:\nIn total, 611 patients were admitted with COVID-19, confirmed by either reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or computed tomography (CT).\n\n There were 363 males, and the age ranged from 18 to 98 years, with an average age of 57±15 years.\n\n Of these, 165 participants had severe disease (53 deaths, case fatality rate: 8.7%).\n\n Among those with hypertension (n=249), ARB exposure was compatible with decreased odds (OR=0.60, 95% CI: 0.27–1.36, p=0.31) of severe disease though not statistically significant, while ACEi exposure significantly reduced the risk of severe disease (OR=0.37, 95% CI: 0.15–0.87, p=0.03).\n\n ACEi exposure was associated with milder infiltrations seen on baseline CT, lower C-reactive protein and ferritin, higher monocytes, shorter hospitalization, and less requirement for specific empirical treatments (favipiravir and meropenem).\n\n\nConclusion:\nOur data suggest that exposure to ACEi drugs may have favorable effects in the context of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7414823","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Naci","surname":"?enkal","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"

Patients Hospitalised with COVID-19: A Retrospective Italian Cohort Study of 43,000 Patients","abstract":"Introduction\nThe epidemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been spreading globally, raising increasing concerns.\n\n There are several controversial hypotheses on the potentially harmful or beneficial effects of antihypertensive drugs acting on the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\n Furthermore, there is accumulating evidence, based on several observational studies, that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) do not increase the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n On the other hand, conflicting findings regarding the role of ACEIs/ARBs as prognosis modifiers in COVID-19 hospitalised patients have been reported.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this large-scale, retrospective cohort study was to investigate whether prior exposure to ACEIs and/or ARBs was associated with all-cause mortality among over 40,000 hospitalised COVID-19 patients compared with calcium channel blockers (CCBs), a potential therapeutic alternative.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study was conducted using COVID-19 registries linked to claims databases from Lombardy, Veneto and Reggio Emilia (overall, 25% of Italian population).\n\n Overall, 42,926 patients hospitalised between 21 February and 21 April 2020 with a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction tests were included in this study.\n\n All-cause mortality occurring in or out of hospital, as reported in the COVID-19 registry, was estimated.\n\n Using Cox models, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause mortality (along with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were estimated separately for ACEIs/ARBs and other antihypertensives versus CCBs and non-use.\n\n\nResults\nOverall, 11,205 in- and out-of-hospital deaths occurred over a median of 24 days of follow-up after hospital admission due to COVID-19. Compared with CCBs, adjusted analyses showed no difference in the risk of death among ACEI (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89–1.06) or ARB (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89–1.06) users.\n\n When non-use of antihypertensives was considered as a comparator, a modest statistically significant increase in mortality risk was observed for any antihypertensive use.\n\n However, when restricting to drugs with antihypertensive indications only, these marginal increases disappeared.\n\n Sensitivity and subgroup analyses confirmed our main findings.\n\n\nConclusions\nACEI/ARB use is not associated with either an increased or decreased risk of all-cause mortality, compared with CCB use, in the largest cohort of hospitalised COVID-19 patients exposed to these drugs studied to date.\n\n The use of these drugs therefore does not affect the prognosis of COVID-19. This finding strengthens recommendations of international regulatory agencies about not withdrawing/switching ACEI/ARB treatments to modify COVID-19 prognosis.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s40264-020-00994-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7450482","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_Springer_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gianluca","surname":"Trifirò","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Marco","surname":"Massari","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":" Marco","surname":"Massari","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Roberto","surname":"Da Cas","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Francesca","surname":"Menniti Ippolito","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Janet","surname":"Sultana","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Salvatore","surname":"Crisafulli","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Paolo","surname":"Giorgi Rossi","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Massimiliano","surname":"Marino","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Manuel","surname":"Zorzi","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Emanuela","surname":"Bovo","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Olivia","surname":"Leoni","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Monica","surname":"Ludergnani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Stefania","surname":"Spila Alegiani","email":"stefania.spila@iss.it","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Stefania","surname":"Spila Alegiani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Francesca","surname":"Menniti Ippolito","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Roberto","surname":"Da Cas","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Marco","surname":"Massari","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Giuseppe","surname":"Traversa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Graziano","surname":"Onder","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Gianluca","surname":"Trifirò","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Janet","surname":"Sultana","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Valentina","surname":"Ientile","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Salvatore","surname":"Crisafulli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Paolo","surname":"Giorgi Rossi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Roberto","surname":"Grilli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Giulio","surname":"Formoso","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Massimiliano","surname":"Marino","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Massimo","surname":"Vicentini","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Olivia","surname":"Leoni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Monica","surname":"Ludergnani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Danilo","surname":"Cereda","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Eliana","surname":"Ferroni","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Stefano","surname":"Guzzinati","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Emanuela","surname":"Bovo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Manuel","surname":"Zorzi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"                               Massimo","surname":"Gion","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s11684-020-0800-y","date":"2020-06-03","title":"Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in context of COVID-19 outbreak: a retrospective analysis","abstract":"The possible effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) on COVID-19 disease severity have generated considerable debate.\n\n We performed a single-center, retrospective analysis of hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, who had definite clinical outcome (dead or discharged) by February 15, 2020.

inducing elevated expression of ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), the cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) or ACE inhibitors treatment may have a controversial role in both facilitating virus infection and reducing pathogenic inflammation.\n We aimed to evaluate the effects of ARBs\/ACE inhibitors on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a retrospective, single-center study.\n One hundred twenty-six patients with COVID-19 and preexisting hypertension at Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Wuhan from January 5 to February 22, 2020, were retrospectively allocated to ARBs\/ACE inhibitors group (n=43) and non-ARBs\/ACE inhibitors group (n=83) according to their antihypertensive medication.\n One hundred twenty-five age- and sex-matched patients with COVID-19 without hypertension were randomly selected as nonhypertension controls.\n In addition, the medication history of 1942 patients with hypertension that were admitted to Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine from November 1 to December 31, 2019, before the COVID-19 outbreak were also reviewed for external comparison.\n Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected, analyzed, and compared between these groups.\n The frequency of ARBs\/ACE inhibitors usage in patients with hypertension with or without COVID-19 were comparable.\n Among patients with COVID-19 and hypertension, those received either ARBs\/ACE inhibitors or non-ARBs\/ACE inhibitors had comparable blood pressure.\n However, ARBs\/ACE inhibitors group had significantly lower concentrations of hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein;\nP\n=0.049) and PCT (procalcitonin,\nP\n=0.008).\n Furthermore, a lower proportion of critical patients (9.3% versus 22.9%;\nP\n=0.061) and a lower death rate (4.7% versus 13.3%;\nP\n=0.216) were observed in ARBs\/ACE inhibitors group than non-ARBs\/ACE inhibitors group, although these differences failed to reach statistical significance.\n Our findings thus support the use of ARBs\/ACE inhibitors in patients with COVID-19 and preexisting hypertension.\n\n","id":"10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.120.15143","idformat":"CROSSREF","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"PUBLISHER: Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer
