limited data on maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a case-control study to compare clinical characteristics, maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with and without COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n\nResults\nDuring January 24 to February 29, 2020, there were sixteen pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and eighteen suspected cases who were admitted to labor in the third trimester.\n\n Two had vaginal delivery and the rest took cesarean section.\n\n Few patients presented respiratory symptoms (fever and cough) on admission, but most had typical chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Compared to the controls, COVID-19 pneumonia patients had lower counts of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, C-reactive

were three (18.8%) and three (16.7%) of the mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 pneumonia had preterm delivery due to maternal complications, which were significantly higher than the control

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n The number of affected pregnant women is increasing, but scarce information is available about the clinical features of COVID-19 in pregnancy.\n\n This study aimed to clarify the clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all pregnant women with COVID-19 who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China.\n\n Clinical features, treatments, and maternal and fetal outcomes were assessed.\n\n\nFindings\nSeven patients, admitted to Tongji Hospital from Jan 1, to Feb 8, 2020, were included in our study.\n\n The mean age of the patients was 32 years (range 29–34 years) and the mean gestational age was 39 weeks plus 1 day (range 37 weeks to 41 weeks plus 2 days).\n\n Clinical manifestations were fever (six [86%] patients), cough (one [14%] patient), shortness of breath (one [14%] patient), and diarrhoea (one [14%] patient).\n\n All the patients had caesarean section within 3 days of clinical presentation with an average gestational age of 39 weeks plus 2 days.\n\n The final date of follow-up was Feb 12, 2020. The outcomes of the pregnant women and neonates were good.\n\n Three neonates were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and one neonate was infected with SARS-CoV-2 36 h after birth.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of patients who were infected in late pregnancy appeared very good, and these outcomes were achieved with intensive, active management that might be the best

tests performed on the amniotic fluid and on two samples of the newborn\u2019s nasopharyngeal swabs indicating no vertical transmission of the virus.\n After 10 days of hospital stay and following two negative consecutive RT-PCR assays on the mother\u2019s nasopharyngeal swabs, both the mother and the infant were discharged home in stable clinical conditions.\n Conclusion: Vertical transmission is not likely among the routes of COVID-19 transmission.\n However, data about more number of deliveries to COVID-19 infected mothers is needed to support this conclusion.\n","id":"10.21203/rs.3.rs-22938/v1","idformat":"CROSSREF","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"PUBLISHER: Research Square Platform

acute respiratory distress syndrome in coronavirus disease 2019–infected pregnancy: obstetric and intensive care considerations","abstract":"Since the emergence of a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) in Wuhan, China, at the end of December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 has been associated with severe morbidity and mortality and has left world governments, healthcare systems, and providers caring for vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women, wrestling with the optimal management strategy.\n\n Unique physiologic and ethical considerations negate a one-size-fits-all approach when caring for critically ill pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019, and few resources exist to guide the multidisciplinary team through decisions regarding optimal maternal-fetal surveillance, intensive care procedures, and delivery timing.\n\n We present a case of rapid clinical decompensation and development of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome in a woman at 31 weeks’ gestation to highlight these unique considerations and present an algorithmic approach to the diagnosis and management of the disease.\n\n","id":"PMC7194528","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"William

COVID-19","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of neonates born to SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers and increase the current knowledge on the perinatal consequences of COVID-19. Nineteen neonates were admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 31 to February 29, 2020. Their mothers were clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed with COVID-19. We prospectively collected and analyzed data of mothers and infants.\n\n There are 19 neonates included in the research.\n\n Among them, 10 mothers were confirmed COVID-19 by positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in throat swab, and 9 mothers were clinically diagnosed with COVID-19. Delivery occurred in an isolation room and neonates were immediately separated from the mothers and isolated for at least 14 days.\n\n No fetal distress was found.\n\n Gestational age of the neonates was 38.6 ± 1.5 weeks, and average birth weight was 3293 ± 425 g.\n\n SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in throat swab, urine, and feces of all neonates were negative.\n\n SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in breast milk and amniotic fluid was negative too.\n\n None of the neonates developed clinical, radiologic, hematologic, or biochemical evidence of COVID-19. No vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and no perinatal complications in the third trimester were found in our study.\n\n The delivery should occur in isolation and neonates should be separated from the infected mothers and care givers.\n\n","id":"PMC7152620","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_Springer_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jing","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Wenbin","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Zhaoxian","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Siying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                           Zhihui","surname":"Rong","email":"rongzhihui53@163.com","contributions":"1"}]}]}
