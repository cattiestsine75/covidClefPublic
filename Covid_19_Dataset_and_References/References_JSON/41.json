In hospitalized children and adults with CAP, observational data suggest a strong and independent association between the outpatient exposure to NSAIDs and the occurrence of pleuropulmonary complications (pleural empyema, excavation, and abscess). In the only study taking into account possible protopathic bias, the association still persists.
