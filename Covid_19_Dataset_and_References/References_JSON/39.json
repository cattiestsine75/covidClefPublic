coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute

course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"

has been widely spread.\n We aim to investigate the clinical characteristic and allergy status of patients infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\n\nMethods\n\n\n\nElectronic medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, and radiological materials of 140 hospitalized COVID\u201019 patients, with confirmed result of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 viral infection, were extracted and analyzed.\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\nAn approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7%) and female COVID\u201019 patients was found, with an overall median age of 57.0 years.\n All patients were community\u2010acquired cases.\n Fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%), fatigue (75.0%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (39.6%) were the most common clinical manifestations, whereas hypertension (30.0%) and diabetes mellitus (12.1%) were the most common comorbidities.\n Drug hypersensitivity (11.4%) and urticaria (1.4%) were self\u2010reported by several patients.\n Asthma or other allergic diseases were not reported by any of the patients.\n Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 1.4%) patients and current smokers (1.4%) were rare.\n Bilateral ground\u2010glass or patchy opacity (89.6%) was the most common sign of radiological finding.\n Lymphopenia (75.4%) and eosinopenia (52.9%) were observed in most patients.\n Blood eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe (r = .\n486, P \u003C .\n001) and nonsevere (r = .\n469, P \u003C .\n001) patients after hospital admission.\n Significantly higher levels of D\u2010dimer, C\u2010reactive protein, and procalcitonin were associated with severe patients compared to nonsevere patients (all P \u003C .\n001).\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nDetailed clinical investigation of 140 hospitalized COVID\u201019 cases suggests eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a potential indicator for diagnosis.\n Allergic diseases, asthma, and COPD are not risk factors for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.\n Older age, high number of comorbidities, and more prominent laboratory abnormalities were associated with severe
