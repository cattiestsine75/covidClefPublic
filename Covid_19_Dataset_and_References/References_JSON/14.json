has brought great damage to human health.\n\n The uncontrollable spread and poor progression of COVID?19 have attracted much attention from all over the world.\n\n We designed this study to develop a prognostic nomogram incorporating Prognostic nutritional index (PNI) in COVID?19 patients.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients confirmed with COVID?19 and treated in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January to February 2020 were included in this study.\n\n We used logistic regression analysis to find risk factors of mortality in these patients.\n\n A prognostic nomogram was constructed and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was drawn to evaluate the predictive value of PNI and this prognostic model.\n\n\nResults\nComparison of baseline characteristics showed non?survivors had higher age (P &lt; .\n\n001), male ratio (P = .\n\n038), neutrophil?to?lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (P &lt; .\n\n001), platelet?to?lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (P &lt; .\n\n001), and PNI (P &lt; .\n\n001) than survivors.\n\n In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, independent risk factors of mortality in COVID?19 patients included white blood cell (WBC) (OR 1.285, P = .\n\n039), PNI (OR

9 and April 6, 2020.

severity is vital.\n To support decision making and logistical planning in healthcare systems, this study leverages a database of blood samples from 485 infected patients in the region of Wuhan, China, to identify crucial predictive biomarkers of disease mortality.\n For this purpose, machine learning tools selected three biomarkers that predict the mortality of individual patients more than 10 days in advance with more than 90% accuracy: lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP).\n In particular, relatively high levels of LDH alone seem to play a crucial role in distinguishing the vast majority of cases that require immediate medical attention.\n This finding is consistent with current medical knowledge that high LDH levels are associated with tissue breakdown occurring in various diseases, including pulmonary disorders such as pneumonia.\n Overall, this Article suggests a simple and operable decision rule to quickly predict patients at the highest risk, allowing them to be prioritized and potentially reducing the mortality rate.\n\nEarly and accurate clinical assessment of disease severity in COVID-19 patients is essential for planning the allocation of scarce hospital resources.\n An explainable machine learning tool trained on blood sample data from 485 patients from Wuhan selected three biomarkers for

assessing the risk of death in COVID-19 patients presenting to the emergency room","abstract":"Objective\nThe aims of this study were to develop a multiparametric prognostic model for death in COVID-19 patients and to assess the incremental value of CT disease extension over clinical parameters.\n\n\nMethods\nConsecutive patients who presented to all five of the emergency rooms of the Reggio Emilia province between February 27 and March 23, 2020, for suspected COVID-19, underwent chest CT, and had a positive swab within 10 days were included in this retrospective study.\n\n Age, sex, comorbidities, days from symptom onset, and laboratory data were retrieved from institutional information systems.\n\n CT disease extension was visually graded as &lt; 20%, 2039%, 4059%, or ? 60%.\n\n The association between clinical and CT variables with death was estimated with univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models; model performance was assessed using k-fold cross-validation for the area under the ROC curve (cvAUC).\n\n\nResults\nOf the 866 included patients (median age 59.8, women 39.2%), 93 (10.74%) died.\n\n Clinical variables significantly associated with death in multivariable model were age, male sex, HDL cholesterol, dementia, heart failure, vascular diseases, time from symptom onset, neutrophils, LDH, and oxygen saturation level.\n\n CT disease extension was also independently associated with death (HR = 7.56, 95% CI = 3.49; 16.38 for ? 60% extension).\n\n cvAUCs were 0.927 (bootstrap bias-corrected 95% CI = 0.8990.947) for the clinical model and 0.936 (bootstrap bias-corrected 95% CI = 0.9120.953) when adding CT extension.\n\n\nConclusions\nA prognostic model based on clinical variables is highly accurate in predicting death in COVID-19 patients.\n\n Adding CT disease extension to the model scarcely improves its accuracy.\n\n\nKey Points\n\n Early identification of COVID-19 patients at higher risk of disease progression and death is crucial; the role of CT scan in defining prognosis is unclear.\n\n\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at

around the world.\n Purpose To develop and validate a radiomics nomogram for predicting the fatal outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n Material and Methods The present study consisted of a training dataset (n\u2009=\u200966) and a validation dataset (n\u2009=\u200930) with COVID-19 from January 2020 to March 2020. A radiomics signature was generated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model.\n A radiomics score (Rad-score) was developed from the training cohort.\n The radiomics model, clinical model, and integrated model were built to assess the association between radiomics signature\/clinical characteristics and the mortality of COVID-19 cases.\n The radiomics signature combined with the Rad-score and the independent clinical factors and radiomics nomogram were constructed.\n Results Seven stable radiomics features associated with the mortality of COVID-19 were finally selected.\n A radiomics nomogram was based on a combined model consisting of the radiomics signature and the clinical risk factors indicating optimal predictive performance for the fatal outcome of patients with COVID-19 with a C-index of 0.912 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.867\u20130.957) in the training dataset and 0.907 (95% CI 0.849\u20130.966) in the validation dataset.\n The calibration curves indicated optimal consistency between the prediction and the observation in both training and validation cohorts.\n Conclusion The CT-based radiomics nomogram indicated favorable predictive efficacy for the overall survival risk of patients with COVID-19, which could help clinicians intensively follow up high-risk patients and make timely diagnoses.\n

Retrospective research was performed on two separate hospital datasets from two different countries for model development and validation.\n\n In the first dataset, COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients

five parameters.\n\n Age, Lymphocyte count, D-dimer, CRP, and Creatinine (ALDCC), information acquired at hospital admission, were identified by the logistic regression model as the primary predictors

Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that comorbidity, older age, lower lymphocyte and higher lactate dehydrogenase at presentation were independent high-risk factors for COVID-19 progression.\n\n Incorporating these 4 factors, the nomogram achieved good concordance indexes of 0.86 (95%CI 0.81 - 0.91), and had well-fitted calibration curves.\n\n A novel scoring model, named as CALL, was established, and its area under ROC was 0.91 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.94).\n\n Using a cutoff value of 6 points, the positive and negative predictive values were 50.7% (38.9% - 62.4%) and 98.5% (94.7% - 99.8%), respectively.\n\n\nConclusion\nUsing the CALL score model, clinicians can improve the therapeutic effect and reduce the mortality of COVID-19 with more accurate and reasonable resolutions on medical resources.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184473","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Dong","surname":"Ji","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

association between RDW and mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients has been reported so far; thus, the objective of this study was to determine if that association exists.\n\n\nMethods\nProspective and observational study carried out in 8 Intensive Care Units from 6 hospitals of Canary Islands (Spain) including COVID-19 patients.\n\n We recorded RDW at ICU admission and 30-day survival.\n\n\nResults\nWe found that patients who did not survive (n = 25) compared to surviving patients (n = 118) were older (p = 0.004), showed higher RDW (p = 0.001), urea (p &lt; 0.001), APACHE-II (p &lt; 0.001) and SOFA (p &lt; 0.001), and lower platelet count (p = 0.007) and pH (p = 0.008).\n\n Multiple binomial logistic regression analysis showed that RDW was associated with 30-day mortality after controlling for: SOFA and age (OR = 1.659; 95% CI = 1.1302.434; p = 0.01); APACHE-II and platelet count (OR = 2.062; 95% CI = 1.3593.129; p = 0.001); and pH

mortality in patients with COVID-19. There is an association between high RDW and mortality.\n\n RDW has a good performance to predict 30-day mortality, similar to other severity scores (such as APACHE II and SOFA) but easier and faster

prognosis early and administer precise treatment are of great significance.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study was to use machine learning to construct a model for the analysis of risk factors and prediction of mortality among ICU patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nIn this study, 123 patients with COVID-19 in the ICU of Vulcan Hill Hospital were retrospectively selected from the database, and the data were randomly divided into a training data set (n=98) and test data set (n=25) with a 4:1 ratio.\n\n Significance tests, correlation analysis, and factor analysis were used to screen 100 potential risk factors individually.\n\n Conventional logistic regression methods and four machine learning algorithms were used to construct the risk prediction model for the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 in the ICU.\n\n The performance of these machine learning models was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).\n\n Interpretation and evaluation of the risk prediction model were performed using calibration curves, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), etc, to ensure its stability and reliability.\n\n The outcome was based on the ICU deaths recorded from the database.\n\n\nResults\nLayer-by-layer screening of 100 potential risk factors finally revealed 8 important risk factors that were included in the risk prediction model: lymphocyte percentage, prothrombin time, lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, eosinophil percentage, creatinine, neutrophil percentage, and albumin level.\n\n Finally, an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model established with the 8 important risk factors showed the best recognition ability in the training set of 5-fold cross validation (AUC=0.86) and the verification queue (AUC=0.92).\n\n The calibration curve showed that the risk predicted by the model was in good agreement with the actual risk.\n\n In addition, using the SHAP and LIME algorithms, feature interpretation and sample prediction interpretation algorithms of the XGBoost black box model were implemented.\n\n Additionally, the model was translated into a web-based risk calculator that is freely available for public usage.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe 8-factor XGBoost model predicts risk of death in ICU patients with COVID-19 well; it initially demonstrates stability and can be used effectively to predict COVID-19 prognosis in ICU patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7661105","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"7"},{"firstname":"

COVID-19 in New York City: Model Development and Validation","abstract":"Background\nCOVID-19 has infected millions of people worldwide and is responsible for several hundred thousand fatalities.\n\n The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated thoughtful resource allocation and early identification of high-risk patients.\n\n However, effective methods to meet these needs are lacking.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aims of this study were to analyze the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to hospitals in the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City; to develop machine learning models for making predictions about the hospital course of the patients over clinically meaningful time horizons based on patient characteristics at admission; and to assess the performance of these models at multiple hospitals and time points.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and baseline comparator models to predict in-hospital mortality and critical events at time windows of 3, 5, 7, and 10 days from admission.\n\n Our study population included harmonized EHR data from five hospitals in New York City for 4098 COVID-19positive patients admitted from March 15 to May 22, 2020. The models were first trained on patients from a single hospital (n=1514) before or on May 1, externally validated on patients from four other hospitals (n=2201) before or on May 1, and prospectively validated on all patients after May 1 (n=383).\n\n Finally, we established model interpretability to identify and rank variables that drive model predictions.\n\n\nResults\nUpon cross-validation, the XGBoost classifier outperformed baseline models, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for mortality of 0.89 at 3 days, 0.85 at 5 and 7 days, and 0.84 at 10 days.\n\n XGBoost also performed well for critical event prediction, with an AUC-ROC of 0.80 at 3 days, 0.79 at 5 days, 0.80 at 7 days, and 0.81 at 10 days.\n\n In external validation, XGBoost achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.88 at 3 days, 0.86 at 5 days, 0.86 at 7 days, and 0.84 at 10 days for mortality prediction.\n\n Similarly, the unimputed XGBoost model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.78 at 3 days, 0.79 at 5 days, 0.80 at 7 days, and 0.81 at 10 days.\n\n Trends in performance on prospective validation sets were similar.\n\n At 7 days, acute kidney injury on admission, elevated LDH, tachypnea, and hyperglycemia were the strongest drivers of critical event prediction, while higher age, anion gap, and C-reactive protein were the strongest drivers of mortality prediction.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe externally and prospectively trained and validated machine learning models for mortality and critical events for patients with COVID-19 at different time horizons.\n\n These models identified at-risk patients and uncovered underlying relationships that predicted

medical records of demographics, comorbidities and laboratory tests at the initial presentation.\n\n Primary outcomes were ICU admission and death.\n\n Logistic regression was used to identify independent clinical variables predicting the two outcomes.\n\n The model was validated by splitting the data into 70% for training and 30% for testing.\n\n Performance accuracy was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC).\n\n Five significant variables predicting ICU admission were lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, pulse oxygen saturation, smoking history, and lymphocyte count.\n\n Seven significant variables predicting mortality were heart failure, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulse oxygen saturation, heart rate, and age.\n\n The mortality group uniquely contained cardiopulmonary variables.\n\n The risk score model yielded good accuracy with an AUC of 0.74 ([95% CI, 0.630.85], p = 0.001) for predicting ICU admission and 0.83 ([95% CI, 0.730.92], p&lt;0.001) for predicting mortality for the testing dataset.\n\n This study identified key independent clinical

diagnosed with COVID-19: a nationwide Korean cohort study","abstract":"The rapid spread of COVID-19 has resulted in the shortage of medical resources, which necessitates accurate prognosis prediction to triage patients effectively.\n\n This study used the nationwide cohort of South Korea to develop a machine learning model to predict prognosis based on sociodemographic and medical information.\n\n Of 10,237 COVID-19 patients, 228 (2.2%) died, 7772 (75.9%) recovered, and 2237 (21.9%) were still in isolation or being treated at the last follow-up (April 16, 2020).\n\n The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that age?&gt;?70, male sex, moderate or severe disability, the presence of symptoms, nursing home residence, and comorbidities of diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic lung disease, or asthma were significantly associated with increased risk of mortality (p???0.047).\n\n For machine learning, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), linear support vector machine (SVM), SVM with radial basis function kernel, random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbors were tested.\n\n In prediction of mortality, LASSO and linear SVM demonstrated high sensitivities (90.7% [95% confidence interval: 83.3, 97.3] and 92.0% [85.9, 98.1], respectively) and specificities (91.4% [90.3, 92.5] and 91.8%, [90.7, 92.9], respectively) while maintaining high specificities?&gt;?90%, as well as high area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (0.963 [0.946, 0.979] and 0.962 [0.945, 0.979], respectively).\n\n The most significant predictors for LASSO included old age and preexisting DM or cancer; for RF they were old age, infection route (cluster infection or infection from personal contact), and underlying hypertension.\n\n The proposed prediction model may be helpful for the quick triage of patients without having to wait for the results of additional tests such as laboratory or radiologic studies, during a pandemic when limited medical resources must be wisely allocated without hesitation.\n\n","id":"PMC7599238","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_Springer_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chansik","surname":"An","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

Analysis in China","abstract":"Background\nThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global health emergency.\n\n The cumulative number of new confirmed cases and deaths are still increasing out of China.\n\n Independent predicted factors associated with fatal outcomes remain uncertain.\n\n\nResearch Question\nThe goal of the current study was to investigate the potential risk factors associated with fatal outcomes from COVID-19 through a multivariate Cox regression analysis and a nomogram model.\n\n\nStudy Design and Methods\nA retrospective cohort of 1,590 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 throughout China was established.\n\n The prognostic effects of variables, including clinical features and laboratory findings, were analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier methods and a Cox proportional hazards model.\n\n A prognostic nomogram was formulated to predict the survival of patients with COVID-19.\nResults\nIn this nationwide cohort, nonsurvivors included a higher incidence of elderly people and subjects with coexisting chronic illness, dyspnea, and laboratory abnormalities on admission compared with survivors.\n\n Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age ? 75 years (hazard ratio [HR], 7.86; 95% CI, 2.44-25.35), age between 65 and 74 years (HR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.24-9.5), coronary heart disease (HR, 4.28; 95% CI, 1.14-16.13), cerebrovascular disease (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.07-8.94), dyspnea (HR, 3.96; 95% CI, 1.42-11), procalcitonin level &gt; 0.5 ng/mL (HR, 8.72; 95% CI, 3.42-22.28), and aspartate aminotransferase level &gt; 40 U/L (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-6.73) were independent risk factors associated with fatal outcome.\n\n A nomogram was established based on the results of multivariate analysis.\n\n The internal bootstrap resampling approach suggested the nomogram has sufficient discriminatory power with a C-index of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.85-0.97).\n\n The calibration plots also showed good consistency between the prediction and the observation.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe proposed nomogram accurately predicted clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 based on individual characteristics.\n\n Earlier identification, more intensive surveillance, and appropriate therapy should be considered in patients at high risk.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158802","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ruchong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"6"},{"firstname":"

general practices in England with linkage to covid-19 test results, Hospital Episode Statistics, and death registry data.\n\n 6.08 million adults aged 19-100 years were included in the derivation dataset and 2.17 million in the validation dataset.\n\n The derivation and first validation cohort period was 24 January 2020 to 30 April 2020. The second temporal validation cohort covered the period 1 May 2020 to 30 June 2020.\nMain outcome measures\nThe primary outcome was time to death from covid-19, defined as death due to confirmed or suspected covid-19 as per the death certification or death occurring in a person with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the period 24 January to 30 April 2020. The secondary outcome was time to hospital admission with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Models were fitted in the derivation cohort to derive risk equations using a range of predictor variables.\n\n Performance, including measures of discrimination and calibration, was evaluated in each validation time period.\n\n\nResults\n4384 deaths from covid-19 occurred in the derivation cohort during follow-up and 1722 in the first validation cohort period and 621 in the second validation cohort period.\n\n The final risk algorithms included age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, and a range of comorbidities.\n\n The algorithm had good calibration in the first validation cohort.\n\n For deaths from covid-19 in men, it explained 73.1% (95% confidence interval 71.9% to 74.3%) of the variation in time to death (R2); the D statistic was 3.37 (95% confidence interval 3.27 to 3.47), and Harrells C was 0.928 (0.919 to 0.938).\n\n Similar results were obtained for women, for both outcomes, and in both time periods.\n\n In the top 5% of patients with the highest predicted risks of death, the sensitivity for identifying deaths within 97 days was 75.7%.\n\n People in the top 20% of predicted risk of death accounted for 94% of all deaths from covid-19.\nConclusion\nThe QCOVID population based risk algorithm performed well, showing very high levels of discrimination for deaths and hospital admissions due to covid-19. The absolute risks presented, however, will change over time in line with the prevailing SARS-C0V-2 infection rate and the extent of social distancing measures in place, so they should be interpreted with caution.\n\n The model can be recalibrated for different time periods, however, and has the potential to be dynamically updated as the pandemic evolves.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7574532","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ash K","surname":"Clift","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Carol

COVID-19: a retrospective multicentre cohort study","abstract":"Objective\nThe reliable risk factors for mortality of COVID-19 has not evaluated in well-characterised cohort.\n\n This study aimed to identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality within 56 days in patients with severe infection of COVID-19.\nDesign\nRetrospective multicentre cohort study.\n\n\nSetting\nFive tertiary hospitals of Daegu, South Korea.\n\n\nParticipants\n1005 participants over 19 years old confirmed COVID-19 using real-time PCR from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs.\n\n\nMethods\nThe clinical and laboratory features of patients with COVID-19 receiving respiratory support were analysed to ascertain the risk factors for mortality using the Cox proportional hazards regression model.\n\n The relationship between overall survival and risk factors was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method.\n\n\nOutcome\nIn-hospital mortality for any reason within 56 days.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 1005 patients, 289 (28.8%) received respiratory support, and of these, 70 patients (24.2%) died.\n\n In multivariate analysis, high fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4; HR 2.784), low lymphocyte count (HR 0.480), diabetes (HR 1.917) and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (HR 1.714) were found to be independent risk factors for mortality in patients with COVID-19 receiving respiratory support (all p&lt;0.05).\n\n Regardless of respiratory support, survival in the high FIB-4 group was significantly lower than in the low FIB-4 group (28.8 days vs 44.0 days, respectively, p&lt;0.001).\n\n A number of risk factors were also significantly related to survival in patients with COVID-19 regardless of respiratory support (04 risk factors, 50.2 days; 49.7 days; 44.4 days; 32.0 days; 25.0 days, respectively, p&lt;0.001).\n\n\nConclusion\nFIB-4 index is a useful predictive marker for mortality in patients with COVID-19 regardless of its severity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7662142","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jung Gil","surname":"Park","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Min
