conducted to provide the international community with a deeper understanding of this new infectious disease.\n\n Epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 135 patients in northeast Chongqing were collected and analyzed in this study.\n\n A total of 135 hospitalized patients with COVID?19 were enrolled.\n\n The median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 36?55), and there was no significant gender difference (53.3% men).\n\n The majority of patients had contact with people from the Wuhan area.\n\n Forty?three (31.9%) patients had underlying disease, primarily hypertension (13 [9.6%]), diabetes (12 [8.9%]), cardiovascular disease (7 [5.2%]), and malignancy (4 [3.0%]).\n\n Common symptoms included fever (120 [88.9%]), cough (102 [76.5%]), and fatigue (44 [32.5%]).\n\n Chest computed tomography scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all the patients.\n\n All patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100%]) (Kaletra and interferon were both used), antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]), and corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]).\n\n In addition, many patients received traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (124 [91.8%]).\n\n It is suggested that patients should receive Kaletra early and should be treated by a combination of Western and Chinese medicines.\n\n Compared to the mild cases, the severe ones had lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma levels of Pt, APTT, d?dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, PCT, ALB, C?reactive protein, and aspartate aminotransferase.\n\n This study demonstrates the clinic features and therapies of 135 COVID?19 patients.\n\n Kaletra and TCM played an important role in the treatment of the viral pneumonia.\n\n Further studies are

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"

with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n The aim of this study is to describe laboratory findings in a group of Italian COVID-19 patients in the area of Valcamonica, and correlate abnormalities with disease severity.\nMethods The final study population consisted of 144 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (70 who died during hospital stay and 74 who survived and could be discharged) between March 1 and 30, 2020, in Valcamonica Hospital.\n Demographical, clinical and laboratory data were collected upon hospital admission and were then correlated with outcome (i.\ne.\n in-hospital death vs.\n discharge).\nResults Compared to patients who could be finally discharged, those who died during hospital stay displayed significantly higher values of serum glucose, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), urea, creatinine, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hscTnI), prothrombin time\/international normalized ratio (PT\/INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), D-dimer, C reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and leukocytes (especially neutrophils), whilst values of albumin, hemoglobin and lymphocytes were significantly decreased.\n In multiple regression analysis, LDH, CRP, neutrophils, lymphocytes, albumin, APTT and age remained significant predictors of in-hospital death.\n A regression model incorporating these variables explained 80% of overall variance of in-hospital death.\nConclusions The most important laboratory abnormalities described here in a subset of European COVID-19 patients residing in Valcamonica are highly predictive of in-hospital death and may be useful for guiding risk assessment and clinical
