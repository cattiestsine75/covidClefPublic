Patients were less likely to report shortness of breath and require hospitalization.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn an unselected large cohort of nonadvanced PD patients, COVID?19 risk and mortality did not differ from the general population, but symptoms appeared to be milder.\n\n The possible protective role of vitamin D supplementation warrants future studies.\n\n © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society\n","id":"PMC7300944","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alfonso","surname":"Fasano","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Emanuele","surname":"Cereda","email":"e.cereda@smatteo.pv.it","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Emanuele","surname":"Cereda","email":"e.cereda@smatteo.pv.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Michela","surname":"Barichella","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Michela","surname":"Barichella","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Erica","surname":"Cassani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Valentina","surname":"Ferri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Anna Lena","surname":"Zecchinelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                           Gianni","surname":"Pezzoli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/nu12051359","date":"2020-05-07","title":"25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentrations Are Lower in Patients with Positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with a clinical outcome ranging from mild to severe, including death.\n\n To date, it is unclear why some patients develop severe symptoms.\n\n Many authors have suggested the involvement of vitamin D in reducing the risk of infections; thus, we retrospectively investigated the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations in plasma obtained from a cohort of patients from Switzerland.\n\n In this cohort, significantly lower 25(OH)D levels (p = 0.004) were found in PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 (median value 11.1 ng/mL) patients compared with negative patients (24.6 ng/mL); this was also confirmed by stratifying patients according to age &gt;70 years.\n\n On the basis of this preliminary observation, vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce the risk of infection.\n\n Randomized controlled trials and large population studies should be conducted to evaluate these recommendations and to confirm our preliminary observation.\n\n","id":"PMC7285131","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Antonio","surname":"D’Avolio","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Valeria","surname":"Avataneo","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Valeria","surname":"Avataneo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Alessandra","surname":"Manca","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Jessica","surname":"Cusato","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Amedeo","surname":"De Nicolò","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Amedeo","surname":"De Nicolò","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Renzo","surname":"Lucchini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Franco","surname":"Keller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                           Marco","surname":"Cantù","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s40520-020-01570-8","date":"2020-04-15","title":"The role of vitamin D in the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 infection and mortality","abstract":"WHO declared SARS-CoV-2 a global pandemic.\n\n The present aim was to propose an hypothesis that there is a potential association between mean levels of vitamin D in various countries with cases and mortality caused by COVID-19.

We aimed to establish whether blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration was associated with COVID-19 risk, and whether it explained the higher incidence of COVID-19 in black and South Asian people.\n \nMethods\nUK Biobank recruited 502,624 participants aged 37–73 years between 2006 and 2010. Baseline exposure data, including 25(OH)D concentration and ethnicity, were linked to COVID-19 test results. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed for the association between 25(OH)D and confirmed COVID-19, and the association between ethnicity and both 25(OH)D and COVID-19.\n \nResults\nComplete data were available for 348,598 UK Biobank participants. Of these, 449 had confirmed COVID-19 infection. Vitamin D was associated with COVID-19 infection univariably (OR = 0.99; 95% CI 0.99–0.999; p = 0.013), but not after adjustment for confounders (OR = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.998–1.01; p = 0.208). Ethnicity was associated with COVID-19 infection univariably (blacks versus whites OR = 5.32, 95% CI = 3.68–7.70, p-value&lt;0.001; South Asians versus whites OR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.65–4.25, p-value&lt;0.001). Adjustment for 25(OH)D concentration made little difference to the magnitude of the association.\n \nConclusions\nOur findings do not support a potential link between vitamin D concentrations and risk of COVID-19 infection, nor that vitamin D concentration may explain ethnic differences in COVID-19 infection.\n ","id":"S1871-4021(20)30115-6","idformat":"elsevier_pii","foundapis":"_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":" Claire E.","surname":"Hastie","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daniel F.","surname":"Mackay","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Frederick","surname":"Ho","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Carlos A.","surname":"Celis-Morales","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Srinivasa Vittal","surname":"Katikireddi","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Claire L.","surname":"Niedzwiedz","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bhautesh D.","surname":"Jani","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Welsh","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Frances S.","surname":"Mair","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stuart R.","surname":"Gray","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Catherine A.","surname":"O’Donnell","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jason MR.","surname":"Gill","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Naveed","surname":"Sattar","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jill P.","surname":"Pell","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Claire E.","surname":"Hastie","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daniel F.","surname":"Mackay","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Frederick","surname":"Ho","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Carlos A.","surname":"Celis-Morales","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Srinivasa Vittal","surname":"Katikireddi","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Claire L.","surname":"Niedzwiedz","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bhautesh D.","surname":"Jani","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Welsh","email":"null","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frances S.","surname":"Mair","email":"null","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stuart R.","surname":"Gray","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Catherine A.","surname":"O’Donnell","email":"null","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jason MR.","surname":"Gill","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Naveed","surname":"Sattar","email":"null","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"                          Jill P.","surname":"Pell","email":"null","contributions":"0"}]}]}
