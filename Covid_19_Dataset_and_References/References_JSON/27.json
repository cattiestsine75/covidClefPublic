Three neonates were born prematurely.\n\n There were no deaths or serious neonatal asphyxia events.\n\n All neonatal SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were negative.\n\n No medical staff were infected throughout the patient care period.\n\n\nConclusions\nBoth epidural and general anesthesia were safely used for Cesarean delivery in the parturients with COVID-19. Nevertheless, the incidence of hypotension during epidural anesthesia appeared excessive.\n\n Proper patient transfer, medical staff access procedures, and effective biosafety precautions are important to protect medical staff from COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7090434","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_Springer_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bi-heng","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhong-yuan","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                          Qing-tao","surname":"Meng","email":"mengqingtao2018@126.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamapediatrics.2020.0878","date":"2023-06-05","title":"'Neonatal Early-Onset Infection With SARS-CoV-2 in 33 Neonates Born to Mothers With COVID-19 in Wuhan, China'","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"10.1001/jamapediatrics.2020.0878","idformat":"CROSSREF","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"PUBLISHER: American Medical Association (AMA)","authors":[{"firstname":"Lingkong","surname":"Zeng","email":"xref no email","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Shiwen","surname":"Xia","email":"xref no email","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":" Wenhao","surname":"Yuan","email":"xref no email","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Kai","surname":"Yan","email":"xref no email","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Feifan","surname":"Xiao","email":"xref no email","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Jianbo","surname":"Shao","email":"xref no email","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"       Wenhao","surname":"Zhou","email":"xref no email","contributions":"3"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.cmi.2020.03.034","date":"2020-03-27","title":"Association of COVID-19 with pregnancy outcomes in health-care workers and general women","abstract":"","id":"PMC7141623","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"S.","surname":"Khan","email":"Suliman.khan18@mails.ucas.ac.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"L.","surname":"Jun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"Nawsherwan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"R.","surname":"Siddique","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"G.","surname":"Han","email":"hg7913@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"M.","surname":"Xue","email":"xuemengzhou@zzu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"G.","surname":"Nabi","email":"ghulamnabiqau@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                          J.","surname":"Liu","email":"jbliuzz@163.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/ijgo.13165","date":"2020-04-08","title":"Radiological findings and clinical characteristics of pregnant women with <styled-content style='fixed-case' toggle='no'>COVID</styled-content>?19 pneumonia","abstract":"Objective\nTo study chest CT images and clinical characteristics of COVID?19 pneumonia in pregnant patients to examine any correlation.\n\n\nMethods\nBetween December 31, 2019 and March 7, 2020, 23 hospitalized pregnant patients with confirmed COVID?19 were enrolled in the study.\n\n Clinical presentations were collected retrospectively from records, including laboratory testing, chest CT imaging, and symptoms.\n\n Descriptive analysis and correlation of patients’ clinical and CT characteristics were performed.\n\n Laboratory results from time of first admission and CT absorption (defined as reduction in lesion area, decrease in density, and absorption of some solid components) were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.\n\n\nResults\nFifteen (65.2%) patients were asymptomatic with patchy ground?glass opacity in a single lung lobe.\n\n Eight (34.8%) patients were symptomatic with multiple patchy ground?glass shadows, consolidation, and fibrous stripes.\n\n Differences in lymphocyte percentage and neutrophil granulocyte rate between first admission and CT absorption were significant (P&lt;0.001).\n\n Median absorption time was shorter in the asymptomatic group compared with the symptomatic group (5 vs 10 days; P&lt;0.001).\n\n Median hospitalization time between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients was 14 vs 25.5 days; P&gt;0.001.

Evidence of vertical transmission was assessed by testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal pharyngeal swab samples.\n\n\nResults\nThe median gestational age on admission was 38+0 (interquartile range, 36+0–39+1) weeks.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (50.9%, 59/116) and cough (28.4%, 33/116); 23.3% (27/116) patients

of 8 patients who presented in the first trimester and early second trimester had a missed spontaneous abortion.\n\n Of 99 patients, 21 (21.2%) who delivered had preterm birth, including 6 with

The SARS-CoV-2 infected parturients in the early stages of COVID-19 outbreak was much more than during the later stage. The main clinical characteristics of parturients with COVID-19 were fever (34.8%), cough (33.7%), an increased plasma CRP (52.8%) and a decreased lymphocyte counting (33.7%). A high rate of emergency and a high incidence of anaesthesia-related complications, such as pharyngalgia, multiple puncture, intraoperative hypotension, nausea, vomiting, vertigo and chills in the COVID-19 parturients.
