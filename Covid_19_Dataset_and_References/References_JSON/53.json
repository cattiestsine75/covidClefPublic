(COVID-19) of patients with cancer and to avoid uncontrolled treatment delays or withdrawal, behavioral mistakes, and panic.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nAll queries spontaneously delivered through the WhatsApp instant messaging system commonly used by patients to communicate with oncology units were collected and grouped by homology in five categories.\n\n Responses to the queries were given according to recommendations by the Italian Association of Medical Oncology through WhatsApp and by subsequent phone calls.\n\n Patients were also classified according to the site of the primary tumor, stage of disease, and current treatments.\n\n Analysis of the association between these data and queries was carried out.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe social scenario in Italy is a nationwide lockdown except for hospitals, pharmacies, and food supplies.\n\n Overall, 446 different patients’ WhatsApp conversations were analyzed between March 1 and March 13 and comprised the following: requirement of visit delay by patients undergoing oral therapies or in follow-up, delays in chemotherapy or immunotherapy administration, queries about possible immunosuppression, and changes in lifestyle or daily activities.\n\n Delay requirements were statistically more frequent among patients with prostate or breast cancer compared with those with lung or pancreatic cancer.\n\n Actions taken by oncologists are also reported.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTo our knowledge, the WhatsApp instant messaging system has been occasionally used in other medical settings with controversial results.\n\n In our experience, WhatsApp turned out to be adequate to give a rapid answer to most queries from patients with cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic

analytics are increasingly being integrated into public health regulation.\n\n One specific application is to monitor compliance of website and social media activity with respect to jurisdictional regulations.\n\n These data may then identify breaches of compliance and inform disciplinary actions.\n\n Our study aimed to evaluate the novel use of internet analytics by a Canadian chiropractic regulator to determine their registrants compliance with three regulations related to specific health conditions, pregnancy conditions and most recently, claims of improved immunity during the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n\nMethods\nA customized internet search tool (Market Review Tool, MRT) was used by the College of Chiropractors of British Columbia (CCBC), Canada to audit registrants websites and social media activity.\n\n The audits extracted words whose use within specific contexts is not permitted under CCBC guidelines.\n\n The MRT was first used in October of 2018 to identify words related to specific health conditions.\n\n The MRT was again used in December 2019 for words related to pregnancy and most recently in March 2020 for words related to COVID-19. In these three MRT applications, potential cases of word misuse were evaluated by the regulator who then notified the practitioner to comply with existing regulations by a specific date.\n\n The MRT was then used on that date to determine compliance.\n\n Those found to be non-compliant were referred to the regulator’s inquiry committee.\n\n We mapped this process and reported the outcomes with permission of the regulator.\n\n\nResults\nIn September 2018, 250 inappropriate mentions of specific health conditions were detected from approximately 1250 registrants with 2 failing to comply.\n\n The second scan for pregnancy related terms of approximately1350 practitioners revealed 83 inappropriate mentions.\n\n Following notification, all 83 cases were compliant within the specified timeframe.\n\n Regarding COVID-19 related words, 97 inappropriate mentions of the word “immune” were detected from 1350 registrants with 7 cases of non-compliance.\n\n\nConclusion\nInternet analytics are an effective way for regulators to monitor internet activity to protect the public from misleading statements.\n\n The processes described were effective at bringing about rapid practitioner compliance.\n\n Given the increasing volume of internet activity by healthcare professionals, internet analytics are an important addition for health care regulators to protect the public they serve.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7212512","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_Springer_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Greg","surname":"Kawchuk","email":"greg.kawchuk@ualberta.ca","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Jan","surname":"Hartvigsen","email":"jhartvigsen@health.sdu.dk","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Jan","surname":"Hartvigsen","email":"jhartvigsen@health.sdu.dk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Stan","surname":"Innes","email":"S.Innes@murdoch.edu.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" J.

misleading.\n Moreover, fake-news are far more shared than evidence-based news among social media users and thus, this can potentially lead to decisions that do not consider the individual\u0027s best interest.\n Drawing from this evidence, the present study aims at comparing the type of Tweets and Sina Weibo posts regarding COVID-19 that contain either false or scientific veracious information.\n To that end 1923 messages from each social media were retrieved, classified and compared.\n Results show that there is more false news published and shared on Twitter than in Sina Weibo, at the same

Pandemic in Iraqi Kurdistan: Online Questionnaire Study","abstract":"Background\nIn the first few months of 2020, information and news reports about the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were rapidly published and shared on social media and social networking sites.\n\n While the field of infodemiology has studied information patterns on the Web and in social media for at least 18 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has been referred to as the first social media infodemic.\n\n However, there is limited evidence about whether and how the social media infodemic has spread panic and affected the mental health of social media users.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study is to determine how social media affects self-reported mental health and the spread of panic about COVID-19 in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.\n\n\nMethods\nTo carry out this study, an online questionnaire was prepared and conducted in Iraqi Kurdistan, and a total of 516 social media users were sampled.\n\n This study deployed a content analysis method for data analysis.\n\n Correspondingly, data were analyzed using SPSS software.\n\n\nResults\nParticipants reported that social media has a significant impact on spreading fear and panic related to the COVID-19 outbreak in Iraqi Kurdistan, with a potential negative influence on people’s mental health and psychological well-being.\n\n Facebook was the most used social media network for spreading panic about the COVID-19 outbreak in Iraq.\n\n We found a significant positive statistical correlation between self-reported social media use and the spread of panic related to COVID-19 (R=.\n\n8701).\n\n Our results showed that the majority of youths aged 18-35 years are facing psychological anxiety.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring lockdown, people are using social media platforms to gain information about COVID-19. The nature of the impact of social media panic among people varies depending on an individual's gender, age, and level of education.\n\n Social media has played a key role in spreading anxiety about the COVID-19 outbreak in Iraqi Kurdistan.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7238863","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Nazakat","surname":"Hamassed","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Nazakat","surname":"Hamassed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Hardawan","surname":"Kakashekh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Muhammad","surname":"Saud","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Mohammad Amin","surname":"Bahrami","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Araz Ramazan","surname":"Ahmad","email":"araz.ahmad85@uor.edu.krd","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Araz Ramazan","surname":"Ahmad","email":"araz.ahmad85@uor.edu.krd","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Hersh Rasool","surname":"Murad","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"                           Hersh Rasool","surname":"Murad","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.7759/cureus.7255","date":"2020-03-12","title":"Coronavirus Goes Viral: Quantifying the COVID-19 Misinformation Epidemic on Twitter","abstract":"Background","id":"PMC7152572","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alexander","surname":"Muacevic","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" John R","surname":"Adler","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Ramez","surname":"Kouzy","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Ramez","surname":"Kouzy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Joseph","surname":"Abi Jaoude","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Afif","surname":"Kraitem","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Molly B","surname":"El Alam","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Basil","surname":"Karam","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Elio","surname":"Adib","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Jabra","surname":"Zarka","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Cindy","surname":"Traboulsi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Elie W","surname":"Akl","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                           Khalil","surname":"Baddour","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]}]}
