coronavirus cases in tertiary hospitals in Hubei Province","abstract":"Background\nThe 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei province of China was isolated in January 2020. This study aims to investigate its epidemiologic history, and analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this outbreak.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to the respiratory departments of nine tertiary hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 2019 to January 24, 2020 were retrospectively collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimens.\n\n\nResults\nNone of the 137 patients (61 males, 76 females, aged 20–83 years, median age 57 years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.\n\n Major initial symptoms included fever (112/137, 81.8%), coughing (66/137, 48.2%), and muscle pain or fatigue (44/137, 32.1%), with other, less typical initial symptoms observed at low frequency, including heart palpitations, diarrhea, and headache.\n\n Nearly 80% of the patients had normal or decreased white blood cell counts, and 72.3% (99/137) had lymphocytopenia.\n\n Lung involvement was present in all cases, with most chest computed tomography scans showing lesions in multiple lung lobes, some of which were dense; ground-glass opacity co-existed with consolidation shadows or cord-like shadows.\n\n Given the lack of effective drugs, treatment focused on symptomatic and respiratory support.\n\n Immunoglobulin G was delivered to some critically ill patients according to their conditions.\n\n Systemic corticosteroid treatment did not show significant benefits.\n\n Notably, early respiratory support facilitated disease recovery and improved prognosis.\n\n The risk of death was primarily associated with age, underlying chronic diseases, and median interval from the appearance of initial symptoms to dyspnea.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe majority of patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia present with fever as the first symptom, and most of them still showed typical manifestations of viral pneumonia on chest imaging.\n\n Middle-aged and elderly patients with underlying comorbidities are susceptible to respiratory failure and may have a poorer prognosis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7147277","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"6"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mei-Fang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jing-Ping","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ying-Nan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Min-Hua","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cheng-Hong","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guang-Cai","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hui-Guo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xiu-Yuan","surname":"Hao","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Xiu-Yuan","surname":"Hao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"

rapidly spread to many provinces in China as well as other countries.\n Here we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as potential biomarkers for predicting disease severity in 2019-nCoV-infected patients in Shenzhen, China.\n All 12 cases of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients developed pneumonia and half of them developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n The most common laboratory abnormalities were hypoalbuminemia, lymphopenia, decreased percentage of lymphocytes (LYM) and neutrophils (NEU), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased CD8 count.\n The viral load of 2019-nCoV detected from patient respiratory tracts was positively linked to lung disease severity.\n ALB, LYM, LYM (%), LDH, NEU (%), and CRP were highly correlated to the acute lung injury.\n Age, viral load, lung injury score, and blood biochemistry indexes, albumin (ALB), CRP, LDH, LYM (%), LYM, and NEU (%), may be predictors of disease severity.\n Moreover, the Angiotensin II level in the plasma sample from 2019-nCoV infected patients was markedly elevated and linearly associated to viral load and lung injury.\n Our results suggest a number of potential diagnosis biomarkers and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) drugs for potential repurposing treatment of 2019-nCoV

lavage (BAL) specimens from five patients with severe pneumonia from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Hubei province, China.\n\n Nucleic acids of the BAL were extracted and subjected to next-generation sequencing.\n\n Virus isolation was carried out, and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed.\n\n\nResults\nFive patients hospitalized from December 18 to December 29, 2019 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea accompanied by complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n Chest radiography revealed diffuse opacities and consolidation.\n\n One of these patients

79.0% nucleotide identity with the sequence of SARS-CoV (GenBank NC_004718) and 51.8% identity with the sequence of MERS-CoV (GenBank NC_019843).\n\n The virus is phylogenetically closest to a bat

rapidly spread throughout China.\n\n This study aimed to clarify the characteristics of patients with refractory COVID-19.\nMethods\nIn this retrospective single-center study, we included 155 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1st to February 5th.\n\n The cases were divided into general and refractory COVID-19 groups according to the clinical efficacy after hospitalization, and the difference between groups were compared.\n\n\nResults\nCompared with general COVID-19 patients (45.2%), refractory patients had an older age, male sex, more underlying comorbidities, lower incidence of fever, higher levels of maximum temperature among fever cases, higher incidence of breath shortness and anorexia, severer disease assessment on admission, high levels of neutrophil, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein, lower levels of platelets and albumin, and higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion (P&lt;0.05).\n\n Refractory COVID-19 patients were more likely to receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, and adjunctive treatment including corticosteroid, antiviral drugs and immune enhancer (P&lt;0.05).\n\n After adjustment, those with refractory COVID-19 were also more likely to have a male sex and manifestations of anorexia and fever on admission, and receive oxygen, expectorant and adjunctive agents (P&lt;0.05) when considering the factors of disease severity on admission, mechanical ventilation, and ICU transfer.\n\n\nConclusion\nNearly 50% COVID-19 patients could not reach obvious clinical and radiological remission within 10 days after hospitalization.\n\n The patients with male sex, anorexia and no fever on admission predicted poor efficacy.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184444","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Pingzheng","surname":"Mo","email":"NULL","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":"Yuanyuan","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Liping","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qiu","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hongling","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhenshun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shicheng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ke","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mingqi","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tielong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shihui","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhiyong","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaoping","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ruiying","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qian","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wang","email":"fanndywang@foxmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"
