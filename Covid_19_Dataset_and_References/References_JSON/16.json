been suggested that angiotensin?converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), which are commonly used in patients with hypertension or diabetes and may raise tissue ACE2 levels, could increase the risk of severe COVID?19 infection.\n\n\nMethods and results\nWe evaluated this hypothesis in a consecutive cohort of 1200 acute inpatients with COVID?19 at two hospitals with a multi?ethnic catchment population in London (UK).\n\n The mean age was 68?±?17?years (57% male) and 74% of patients had at least one comorbidity.\n\n Overall, 415 patients (34.6%) reached the primary endpoint of death or transfer to a critical care unit for organ support within 21?days of symptom onset.\n\n A total of 399 patients (33.3%) were taking ACEi or ARB.\n\n Patients on ACEi/ARB were significantly older and had more comorbidities.\n\n The odds ratio for the primary endpoint in patients on ACEi and ARB, after adjustment for age, sex and co?morbidities, was 0.63 (95% confidence interval 0.47–0.84, P?&lt;?0.01).\n\n\nConclusions\nThere was no evidence for increased severity of COVID?19 in hospitalised patients on chronic treatment with ACEi or ARB.\n\n A trend towards a beneficial effect of ACEi/ARB requires further evaluation in larger meta?analyses and randomised clinical trials.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7301045","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Daniel

whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients’ clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic

Sixty-nine patients (12.2%) developed severe pneumonia. Patients who developed severe pneumonia were older (median age of 59 and 45 years, respectively), and more patients had comorbidities including hypertension (30.4% and 12.3%, respectively), diabetes (17.4% and 6.7%, respectively), and cardiovascular disease (8.7% and 3.2%, respectively) and presented with fever (84.1% and 60.4%, respectively) and shortness of breath (10.1% and 3.8%, respectively) compared with those who did not. Nonspecific antiviral therapy did not prevent clinical progression to severe pneumonia, although fewer hypertensive patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) therapy developed severe pneumonia in contrast with those on non-ACEI/ARB antihypertensive therapy (1 of 16 [6.3%] patients and 16 of 49 [32.7%] patients, respectively [difference, 26.4%; 95% CI, 1.5% to 41.3%]). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that hypertension without receiving ACEI/ARB therapy was an independent risk factor (odds ratio [OR], 2.07; 95% CI, 1.07 to 4.00) for developing severe pneumonia irrespective of age. Besides, none of patients treated with chloroquine developed severe pneumonia, though without significance (difference, 12.0%; 95% CI, -3.5% to 30.0%) by propensity score matching.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEHypertensive patients on ACEI or ARB may be protective from severe pneumonia in COVID-19 and hence these therapies should not be ceased unless there is a strong indication or further epidemiological evidence. Though none of the current antiviral and immunoregulation therapy showed benefit in preventing COVID-19 progression, chloroquine deserved further investigation.\n\nKEYPOINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes the use of adjuvant therapy reduce progression to severe pneumonia in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?\n\nFindingsIn this retrospective, observational cohort study involving 564 patients with confirmed COVID-19, hypertension was an independent risk factor for progression to severe pneumonia irrespective of age and those on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy were less likely to develop severe COVID-19 pneumonia, while nonspecific antivirals or chloroquine did not have significant impact on clinical progression.\n\nMeaningHypertensive patients with COVID-19 should not have ACEI or ARB ceased, unless there is a strong indication or further epidemiological evidence, given its potential protective effects.

Wuhan from January 5 to February 22, 2020, were retrospectively allocated to ARBs\/ACE inhibitors group (n=43) and non-ARBs\/ACE inhibitors group (n=83) according to their antihypertensive

patients with hypertension that were admitted to Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine from November 1 to December 31, 2019, before the COVID-19 outbreak were also reviewed for external comparison.\n Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected, analyzed, and compared between these groups.\n The frequency of ARBs\/ACE inhibitors usage in patients with hypertension with or without COVID-19 were comparable.\n Among patients with COVID-19 and hypertension, those received either ARBs\/ACE inhibitors or non-ARBs\/ACE inhibitors had comparable blood pressure.\n However, ARBs\/ACE inhibitors group had significantly lower concentrations of hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein;\nP\n=0.049) and PCT

retrospective clinical investigation on hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypertension as the only comorbidity revealed that the CCB amlodipine besylate therapy was associated with a decreased case fatality rate.\n\n The results from this study suggest that CCB administration to COVID-19 patients with hypertension as the comorbidity might improve the disease outcome.\n\n","id":"PMC7752915","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_Springer_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lei-Ke","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Haolong","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Haolong","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qingxing","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaming","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei-Juan","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shufen","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yu-Lan","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Nian","surname":"Hao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hongbo","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Runming","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Runming","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hao","surname":"Li","email":"lihao_1986@126.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ke","surname":"Peng","email":"pengke@wh.iov.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gengfu","surname":"Xiao","email":"xiaogf@wh.iov.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"

human ACE2 in complex with B0AT1 ","abstract":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the surface receptor for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), directly interacting with the spike glycoprotein (S protein). ACE2 is also suggested to be the receptor for the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is causing a serious epidemic in China manifested with severe respiratory syndrome. B0AT1 (SLC6A19) is a neutral amino acid transporter whose surface expression in intestinal cells requires ACE2. Here we present the 2.9 [A] resolution cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 in complex with B0AT1. The complex, assembled as a dimer of ACE2-B0AT1 heterodimers, exhibits open and closed conformations due to the shifts of the peptidase domains (PDs) of ACE2. A newly resolved Collectrin-like domain (CLD) on ACE2 mediates homo-dimerization. Structural modelling suggests that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins simultaneously, providing important clues to the molecular basis for coronavirus recognition and infection.
