The number of testing teams was also increased to two per lane to allow simultaneous testing of multiple participants on days 2–4. Consistent staffing on all days helped optimize proficiency, and strong community partnership was essential from planning through execution.\n\n\nConclusions\nHigh-volume ascertainment of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence by PCR and antibody testing was feasible when conducted in a community-led, drive-through model in a non-urban area.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains

drive-through (DT) screening system for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by comparing it with a conventional screening system.\n\n We reviewed and analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 screening data obtained at our university hospital.\n\n We compared the number of tests for SARS-CoV-2 (using real-time polymerase chain reaction) performed using two different specimen collection systems—DT and conventional—during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Daegu.\n\n Based on the results, the DT screening system collected 5.8 times more specimens for testing than the conventional screening system.\n\n From 27 January to 31 March 2020, 6211 individuals were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection using either the DT or conventional system.\n\n In total, 217 individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (positive rate: 3.50%).\n\n Of the 6211 individuals, 3368 were symptomatic or had a history of contact with COVID-19 patients, and 142 of them tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (positive rate: 4.22%).\n\n Further, 2843 individuals were asymptomatic and had no history of contact with COVID-19 patients, and 75 of them tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (positive rate: 2.64%).\n\n In conclusion, the DT system allowed clinicians to collect specimens for SARS-CoV-2 screening more efficiently than the conventional system.\n\n Furthermore, as there might be several COVID-19 patients who remain asymptomatic, expanding the screening test to asymptomatic individuals would be necessary.\n\n","id":"PMC7348970","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Min Cheol","surname":"Chang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

cohorts.\n\n Unfortunately, current facility-based testing compounds shortcomings in testing availability, neglecting those who are frail or physically unable to travel to a testing facility.\n\n\nMethods\nWe developed an emergency medical service (EMS)-based home testing and evaluation program, leveraging existing community EMS resources.\n\n This program has kept vulnerable populations out of the emergency department, reduced cost, and improved access to care.\n\n\nResults\nOur EMS-based testing program can test approximately 15 homebound patients per day.\n\n Through April 2020 our program had performed 477 home-based tests.\n\n Additionally, we have recently undertaken several mass testing operations, testing up to 900 patients per testing site.\n\n\nConclusion\nFacility-based SARS-CoV-2 testing requires that a patient physically present to a facility for a nasopharyngeal swap to be collected.\n\n Unfortunately, access may be limited for patients that are homebound, chronically ill, or without a means of private transportation.\n\n By leveraging existing EMS infrastructure in new ways, our community has been able to keep almost 500 vulnerable patients in their home.\n\n Using EMS, we can strengthen the healthcare system’s response to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and support at-risk populations, including those that are

including the booths, and adverse reactions with disinfection of the booths.\n\n These limitations can be overcome using mobile technology and increasing the number of booths to reduce congestion inside the center, reducing booth volume for sufficient and rapid ventilation, and using an effective, harmless, and certified environmental disinfectant.\n\n A WT center can be implemented in other

MSCS.\n\n The gloves are used to conduct sampling of throat/nasal swabs, sputum, and blood from patients.\n\n The gap between the board and the building is only 0.2?cm (sealed with silicone sealant).\n\n ED personnel communicate with patients using a small two-way broadcast system.\n\n Medical waste is put in specific trashcans installed in the table outside the MSCS.\n\n With full physical protection, the personnel conducting the sampling procedure need to wear only their N95 mask and gloves.\n\n After we activated the station, our PPE, sampling time, and sanitization resources
