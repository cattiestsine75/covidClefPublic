Health facilities in the regions most affected by Zika lacked the capacity to respond to the increased demand for contraception.\n\n The objectives were to explore healthcare users’ perceptions regarding contraception, Zika prevention during pregnancy and post-abortion care (PAC) services in the context of a Zika outbreak in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and to follow these services over time.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study was part of a broader implementation research study.\n\n We used qualitative research consistent with grounded theory approach.\n\n Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were performed with women and their partners who used contraceptive services or received PAC services.\n\n Data were collected in two stages from December 2017 to July 2018. Themes explored included contraception, Zika and PAC services.\n\n\nResults\nParticipants had positive attitude towards the use of contraceptive methods and demanded more information on safety, efficacy and on side effects.\n\n Health care services were inconsistent in the provision of information on Zika and contraception services.\n\n ZIKV vector transmission was known but fewer participants were aware of risk of sexual transmission of Zika.\n\n Barriers to access healthcare services included contraceptive and PAC services included distance to healthcare facilities, disorganized admission process, long waiting times and out-of-pocket expenditure to purchase medicines.\n\n Furthermore, poor quality, mistreatment and abuse of women seeking PAC was prevalent.\n\n Some positive changes were noted over time, such as improvements in infrastructure including improved privacy and cleanliness, removal of fees, requisite to bring clean water to hospital.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur results highlight the challenges and areas for improvement in policy and practice related to contraceptive services and PAC in the context of ZIKV infection.\n\n Public policies to prevent epidemics should focus more on providing proper sanitation; removing barriers to access and use of effective contraception as human rights priority.\n\n Zika epidemic has highlighted weaknesses in health systems that obstruct access to and use of sexual and reproductive health services.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7488691","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_Springer_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria","surname":"Belizan","email":"mbelizan@iecs.org.ar","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Edna","surname":"Maradiaga","email":"edjamar3006@yahoo.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Javier","surname":"Roberti","email":"jroberti@iecs.org.ar","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maricela","surname":"Casco-Aguilar","email":"marykasco@yahoo.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alison

identify the factors that affect this high priority population’s ability to successfully comply with vaccination recommendations.\n By utilizing an existing communication framework through the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children (WIC) they were able to document the systems and infrastructure needed to foster constructive responses in a sustainable manner in the future.\n Six focus group discussions with WIC clients (n = 56) and 10 individual interviews with staff members were conducted at two WIC clinics in Georgia (1 urban and 1 rural).\n Data were collected after the 2009–2010 influenza season and analyzed using thematic analysis.\n Knowledge and attitudes regarding H1N1 differed among participants with regard to perceived severity and perceived risk of influenza illness.\n Participants identified several barriers and motivators to receiving the vaccination, as well as information needs, sources, and information-seeking behaviors.\n Similarities emerged among both WIC clients and staff members regarding impressions of H1N1 and the vaccine’s use, suggesting that while the information may be provided, it is not effectively understood or accepted.\n Comprehensive education, policy and planning development regarding pandemic influenza and vaccine acceptance among low-income women is necessary, including improvements in

reluctance for pregnancy: Experiences and perceptions of Zika virus in Medellin, Colombia","abstract":"Objective\nTo explore how being infected with the Zika virus during pregnancy was experienced by affected women, and how it influenced their family relationships and future family planning.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a qualitative study, including 19 semistructured interviews with women of reproductive age and confirmed Zika infection during 2015–2018 in Medellin, Colombia.\n\n Purposeful sampling was applied, and participants were identified through National Public Health Surveillance System records.\n\n Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using content analysis with inductive and deductive approaches.\n\n\nResults\nOf 19 women interviewed, eight women identified the pregnancy as unexpected and two women had undergone permanent sterilization.\n\n Women had mixed views about decision?making related to family planning, and not having an abortion in a future pregnancy was influenced by religious beliefs.\n\n Women knew about vector?borne transmission but were not well informed about sexual transmission of the virus.\n\n Women desired better support and guidance to ease concerns about Zika virus.\n\n\nConclusion\nAll interviewed women expressed a need for more information about Zika virus and continuous support, specifically after delivery, from healthcare professionals.\n\n Communication strategies to enhance culturally sensitive messages and for accurate perception of information are recommended during Zika outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7064904","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Veronika","surname":"Tirado","email":"Veronika.Tirado@ki.se","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Santiago

the COVID-19 pandemic: a UK-based focus group study","abstract":"Objective\nThis study explored UK public perceptions and experiences of social distancing and social isolation related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nDesign\nThis qualitative study comprised five focus groups, carried out online during the early stages of the UK’s stay at home order (‘lockdown’), and analysed using a thematic approach.\n\n\nSetting\nFocus groups took place via online videoconferencing.\n\n\nParticipants\nParticipants (n=27) were all UK residents aged 18 years and older, representing a range of gender, ethnic, age and occupational backgrounds.\n\n\nResults\nQualitative analysis revealed four main themes: (1) loss—participants’ loss of (in-person) social interaction, loss of income and loss of structure and routine led to psychological and emotional ‘losses’ such as loss of motivation, loss of meaning and loss of self-worth; (2) criticisms of government communication—participants reported a lack of trust in government and a lack of clarity in the guidelines around social distancing and isolation; (3) adherence—participants reported high self-adherence to social distancing guidelines but reported seeing or hearing of non-adherence in others; (4) uncertainty around social reintegration and the future—some participants felt they would have lingering concerns over social contact while others were eager to return to high levels of social activity.\n\n\nConclusions\nA rapid response is necessary in terms of public health programming to mitigate the mental health impacts of COVID-19 social distancing and isolation.\n\n Social distancing and isolation ‘exit strategies’ must account for the fact that, although some individuals will voluntarily or habitually continue to socially distance, others will seek high levels of social engagement as soon as possible.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7387310","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Simon
