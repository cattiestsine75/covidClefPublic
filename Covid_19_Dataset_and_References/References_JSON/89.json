health effects, but whether excess mortality after 9/11 has occurred is unknown. We tested whether excess mortality has occurred in people exposed to the WTC disaster.\n \nMethods\nIn this observational cohort study, deaths occurring in 2003–09 in WTC Health Registry participants residing in New York City were identified through linkage to New York City vital records and the National Death Index. Eligible participants were rescue and recovery workers and volunteers; lower Manhattan area residents, workers, school staff and students; and commuters and passers-by on 9/11. Study participants were categorised as rescue and recovery workers (including volunteers), or non-rescue and non-recovery participants. Standardised mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated with New York City rates from 2000–09 as the reference. Within the cohort, proportional hazards were used to examine the relation between a three-tiered WTC-related exposure level (high, intermediate, or low) and total mortality.\n \nFindings\nWe identified 156 deaths in 13?337 rescue and recovery workers and 634 deaths in 28?593 non-rescue and non-recovery participants. All-cause SMRs were significantly lower than that expected for rescue and recovery participants (SMR 0·45, 95% CI 0·38–0·53) and non-rescue and non-recovery participants (0·61, 0·56–0·66). No significantly increased SMRs for diseases of the respiratory system or heart, or for haematological malignancies were found. In non-rescue and non-recovery participants, both intermediate and high levels of WTC-related exposure were significantly associated with mortality when compared with low exposure (adjusted hazard ratio 1·22, 95% CI 1·01–1·48, for intermediate exposure and 1·56, 1·15–2·12, for high exposure). High levels of exposure in non-rescue and non-recovery individuals, when compared with low exposed non-rescue and non-recovery individuals, were associated with heart-disease-related mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 2·06, 1·10–3·86). In rescue and recovery participants, level of WTC-related exposure was not significantly associated with all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1·25, 95% CI 0·56–2·78, for high exposure and 1·03, 0·52–2·06, for intermediate exposure when compared with low exposure).\n \nInterpretation\nThis exploratory study of mortality in a well defined cohort of 9/11 survivors provides a baseline for continued surveillance.

Methods: Structured interviews were conducted with 19 hurricane survivors to assess psychological strains (PTSD, perceived stress, depression, and anxiety) and measure CHD risks.\n Saliva samples were collected by the passive drool method and analyzed for inflammatory cytokine (interleukin [IL]-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-10) and chemokine (monocyte chemotactic protein [MCP]-1) biomarkers.\n Results: The salivary level of MCP-1 was significantly associated with PTSD symptoms, depression (both p &lt; .\n01), and anxiety ( p &lt; .\n05).\n There were significant associations between anxiety and hypertension ( p &lt; .\n01), perceived stress and blood glucose level ( p &lt; .\n05), and perceived stress and obesity ( p &lt; .\n05).\n Conclusion: Our findings that long-lasting psychological strains are associated with major CHD risks and salivary MCP-1 levels suggest that the mechanism by which such strains play a role in the development of CHD involves recruitment of monocyte cells in response to chronic endothelial inflammation.\n Further studies are needed to advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which the PTSD and other psychological strains contribute to the development of CHD.\n ","id":"10.1177/1099800414551164","idformat":"CROSSREF","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"PUBLISHER: SAGE Publications","authors":[{"firstname":"Kyungeh","surname":"An","email":"xref no

a nationally representative sample ","abstract":"\nObjective\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is significantly and positively associated with several physical conditions. We aimed to examine whether the nature and number of trauma(s) experienced may be related to physical conditions using a population-based sample.\n \nMethods\nData came from Wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (N=34,653; age 20 years and older). Participants indicated lifetime trauma experiences and physical conditions experienced over the past year. Multiple logistic regressions examined the association between type and number of trauma(s) and physical conditions.\n \nResults\nAfter adjusting for sociodemographics, Axis I and II mental disorders, and all other trauma, injurious and witnessing trauma were significantly associated with all the assessed physical conditions. Psychological trauma was associated with cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases, diabetes and arthritis. Natural disaster/terrorism was associated with cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal disease and arthritis only. Finally, combat-related trauma and other trauma were not positively associated with any physical condition. Our results also suggested a dose–response relationship between number of traumatic events and physical conditions.\n \nConclusion\nThese data suggest that the impact of certain types and number of traumas may differ with respect to their relationship with physical health problems independent of PTSD.\n ","id":"S0163-8343(13)00185-0","idformat":"elsevier_pii","foundapis":"_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":" M.

They were associated with great excess mortality (from 1,300 to 13,700 deaths).\n The observations are compatible with a moderate harvesting effect for four of the six HW.\n The mortality ratios increased with age for subjects aged over 55 years and were higher for women than for men over 75 years.\n For the six HW, the excess mortality was significant for almost all the causes of death: (1) the greatest excess mortality (O–E) were observed for cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, respiratory system diseases, HRC, ill-defined conditions and injury and poisoning, and (2) the mortality ratios (O/E) were highest for HRC, respiratory diseases, nervous system diseases, mental disorders, infectious diseases, and endocrine and nutritional diseases.\n\nConclusions\nHeat waves associated with excess mortality are not rare events in this temperate-climate country.\n The excess mortality is much greater than HRC mortality.\n Some populations are particularly vulnerable to HW: the elderly, women and people with some specific diseases.\n However, no segment of the population may be considered protected from the risks associated with HW.\n","id":"10.1007/s00420-007-0173-4","idformat":"Springer","foundapis":"_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":" Grégoire","surname":"Rey","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Jougla","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anne","surname":"Fouillet","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gérard","surname":"Pavillon","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pierre","surname":"Bessemoulin","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Philippe","surname":"Frayssinet","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jacqueline","surname":"Clavel","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                  Denis","surname":"Hémon","email":"null","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1017/dmp.2018.22","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The Incidence, Risk Factors, and Chronobiology of Acute Myocardial Infarction Ten Years After Hurricane Katrina","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"10.1017/dmp.2018.22","idformat":"CORE","foundapis":"_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ahmad","surname":"Jabbar","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alaa","surname":"Boulad","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anand","surname":"Irimpen","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bradley","surname":"Deere","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christopher","surname":"Westley","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hassan","surname":"Baydoun","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Holly","surname":"Gonzales","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Indrajeet","surname":"Mahata","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"John","surname":"C.
