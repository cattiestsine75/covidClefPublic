expanded in Vitoria by March 18th, 2020.\nMethods\nWe identified patients from the two public hospitals in Vitoria who were admitted to ICU with confirmed infection by SARS-CoV-2. Data reported here were available in April 6th, 2020. Mortality was assessed in those who completed 15-days of ICU stay.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 48 patients (27 males) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Median [interquartile range (IQR)] age of patients was 63 [5175] years.\n\n Symptoms began a median of 7 [512] days before ICU admission.\n\n The most common comorbidities identified were obesity (48%), arterial hypertension (44%) and chronic lung disease (37%).\n\n All patients were admitted by hypoxemic respiratory failure and none received non-invasive mechanical ventilation.\n\n Forty-five (94%) underwent intubation, 3 (6%) high flow nasal therapy (HFNT), 1 (2%) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and 22 (46%) required prone position.\n\n After 15 days, 14/45 (31%) intubated

while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavirritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavirritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care

targets warranting rapid investigation.\n\n\nObjective\nThis study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, for coronavirus disease 2019.\nMethods\nWe conducted a prospective, multicenter, single-blind, randomized controlled phase II trial involving patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019.\nResults\nForty-three patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ruxolitinib plus standard-of-care treatment (22 patients) or placebo based on standard-of-care treatment (21 patients).\n\n After exclusion of 2 patients (1 ineligible, 1 consent withdrawn)

anakinra in patients with COVID-19, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and hyperinflammation: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nMortality of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and systemic inflammation is high.\n\n In areas of pandemic outbreak, the number of patients can exceed maximum capacity of intensive care units (ICUs), and, thus, these individuals often receive non-invasive ventilation outside of the ICU.\n\n Effective treatments for this population are needed urgently.\n\n Anakinra is a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist that might be beneficial in this patient population.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy.\n\n We included consecutive patients (aged ?18 years) with COVID-19, moderate-to-severe ARDS, and hyperinflammation (defined as serum C-reactive protein ?100 mg/L, ferritin ?900 ng/mL, or both) who were managed with non-invasive ventilation outside of the ICU and who received standard treatment of 200 mg hydroxychloroquine twice a day orally and 400 mg lopinavir with 100 mg ritonavir twice a day orally.\n\n We compared survival, mechanical ventilation-free survival, changes in C-reactive protein, respiratory function, and clinical status in a cohort of patients who received additional treatment with anakinra (either 5 mg/kg twice a day intravenously [high dose] or 100 mg twice a day subcutaneously [low dose]) with a retrospective cohort of patients who did not receive anakinra (referred to as the standard treatment group).\n\n All outcomes were assessed at 21 days.\n\n This study is part of the COVID-19 Biobank study, which is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04318366.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween March 17 and March 27, 2020, 29 patients received high-dose intravenous anakinra, non-invasive ventilation, and standard treatment.\n\n Between March 10 and March 17, 2020, 16 patients received non-invasive ventilation and standard treatment only and comprised the comparison group for this study.\n\n A further seven patients received low-dose subcutaneous anakinra in addition to non-invasive ventilation and standard treatment; however, anakinra treatment was interrupted after 7 days because of a paucity of effects on serum C-reactive protein and clinical status.\n\n At 21 days, treatment with high-dose anakinra was associated with reductions in serum C-reactive protein and progressive improvements in respiratory function in 21 (72%) of 29 patients; five (17%) patients were on mechanical ventilation and three (10%) died.\n\n In the standard treatment group, eight (50%) of 16 patients showed respiratory improvement at 21 days; one (6%) patient was on mechanical ventilation and seven (44%) died.\n\n At 21 days, survival was 90% in the high-dose anakinra group and 56% in the standard treatment group (p=0·009).\n\n Mechanical ventilation-free survival was 72% in the anakinra group versus 50% in the standard treatment group (p=0·15).\n\n Bacteraemia occurred in four (14%) of 29 patients receiving high-dose anakinra and two (13%) of 16 patients receiving standard treatment.\n\n Discontinuation of anakinra was not followed by inflammatory relapses.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn this retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 and ARDS managed with non-invasive ventilation outside of the ICU, treatment with high-dose anakinra was safe and associated with clinical improvement in 72% of patients.\n\n Confirmation of efficacy will require controlled

Outcome in Hospitalized Subjects With Coronavirus Disease 2019 From a Nationwide Analysis in China","abstract":"Background\nThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global health emergency.\n\n The cumulative number of new confirmed cases and deaths are still increasing out of China.\n\n Independent predicted factors associated with fatal outcomes remain uncertain.\n\n\nResearch Question\nThe goal of the current study was to investigate the potential risk factors associated with fatal outcomes from COVID-19 through a multivariate Cox regression analysis and a nomogram model.\n\n\nStudy Design and Methods\nA retrospective cohort of 1,590 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 throughout China was established.\n\n The prognostic effects of variables, including clinical features and laboratory findings, were analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier methods and a Cox proportional hazards model.\n\n A prognostic nomogram was formulated to predict the survival of patients with COVID-19.\nResults\nIn this nationwide cohort, nonsurvivors included a higher incidence of elderly people and subjects with coexisting chronic illness, dyspnea, and laboratory abnormalities on admission compared with survivors.\n\n Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age ? 75 years (hazard ratio [HR], 7.86; 95% CI, 2.44-25.35), age between 65 and 74 years (HR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.24-9.5), coronary heart disease (HR, 4.28; 95% CI, 1.14-16.13), cerebrovascular disease (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.07-8.94), dyspnea (HR, 3.96; 95% CI, 1.42-11), procalcitonin level &gt; 0.5 ng/mL (HR, 8.72; 95% CI, 3.42-22.28), and aspartate aminotransferase level &gt; 40 U/L (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-6.73) were independent risk factors associated with fatal outcome.\n\n A nomogram was established based on the results of multivariate analysis.\n\n The internal bootstrap resampling approach suggested the nomogram has sufficient discriminatory power with a C-index of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.85-0.97).\n\n The calibration plots also showed good consistency between the prediction and the observation.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe proposed nomogram accurately predicted clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 based on individual characteristics.\n\n Earlier identification, more intensive surveillance, and appropriate therapy should be considered in patients at high risk.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158802","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ruchong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenhua","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mei","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Weijie","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Zhan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chunli","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ling","surname":"Sang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiaxing","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhengyi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chunliang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yixiang","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yahua","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiyang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhijian","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shaoqin","surname":"Qiu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Changjiang","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shaoyong","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoqing","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linling","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Feng","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinping","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nuofu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yimin","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianxing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiyue","surname":"Li","email":"lishiyue@188.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nanshan","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"

USA) as of April 28, 2020. Data on the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this setting are needed.\n\n\nMethods\nThis prospective observational cohort study took place at two NewYork-Presbyterian hospitals affiliated with Columbia University Irving Medical Center in northern Manhattan.\n\n We prospectively identified adult patients (aged ?18 years) admitted to both hospitals from March 2 to April 1, 2020, who were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and were critically ill with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, and collected clinical, biomarker, and treatment data.\n\n The primary outcome was the rate of in-hospital death.\n\n Secondary outcomes included frequency and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, frequency of vasopressor use and renal replacement therapy, and time to in-hospital clinical deterioration following admission.\n\n The relation between clinical risk factors, biomarkers, and in-hospital mortality was modelled using Cox proportional hazards regression.\n\n Follow-up time was right-censored on April 28, 2020 so that each patient had at least 28 days of observation.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween March 2 and April 1, 2020, 1150 adults were admitted to both hospitals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, of which 257 (22%) were critically ill.\n\n The median age of patients was 62 years (IQR 5172), 171 (67%) were men.\n\n 212 (82%) patients had at least one chronic illness, the most common of which were hypertension (162 [63%]) and diabetes (92 [36%]).\n\n 119 (46%) patients had obesity.\n\n As of April 28, 2020, 101 (39%) patients had died and 94 (37%) remained hospitalised.\n\n 203 (79%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation for a median of 18 days (IQR 928), 170 (66%) of 257 patients received vasopressors and 79 (31%) received renal replacement therapy.\n\n The median time to in-hospital deterioration was 3 days (IQR 16).\n\n In the multivariable Cox model, older age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1·31 [1·091·57] per 10-year increase), chronic cardiac disease (aHR 1·76 [1·082·86]), chronic pulmonary disease (aHR 2·94 [1·485·84]), higher concentrations of interleukin-6 (aHR 1·11 [95%CI 1·021·20] per decile increase), and higher concentrations of D-dimer (aHR 1·10 [1·011·19] per decile increase) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality.\n\n\nInterpretation\nCritical illness among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in New York City is common and associated with a high frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation, extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, and substantial in-hospital mortality.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Center for Advancing Translational
