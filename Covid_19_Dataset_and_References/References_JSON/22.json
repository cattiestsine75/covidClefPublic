We aimed to evaluate the definite efficacy and safety of corticosteroid in the treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\nMethodsForty-six hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia hospitalized at Wuhan Union Hospital from January 20 to February 25, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether they received corticosteroid treatment. The clinical symptoms and chest computed tomography(CT) results were compared.\n\nResultsA total of 26 patients received intravenous administration of methylprednisolone with a dosage of 1-2mg/kg/d for 5-7 days, while the remaining patients not. There was no significant difference in age, sex, comorbidities, clinical or laboratory parameters between the two groups on admission. The average number of days for body temperature back to the normal range was significantly shorter in patients with administration of methylprednisolone when compared to those without administration of methylprednisolone (2.06{+/-}0.28 vs. 5.29{+/-}0.70, P=0.010). The patients with administration of methylprednisolone had a faster improvement of SpO2, while patients without administration of methylprednisolone had a significantly longer interval of using supplemental oxygen therapy (8.2days[IQR 7.0-10.3] vs. 13.5days(IQR 10.3-16); P<0.001). In terms of chest CT, the absorption degree of the focus was significantly better in patients with administration of methylprednisolone.\n\nConclusionOur data indicate that in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early, low-dose and short-term application of corticosteroid was associated with a faster improvement of clinical symptoms and absorption of lung focus.

We identified antibodies that potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2; this activity correlates with competition with ACE2 for binding to RBD.\n Unexpectedly, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the infected plasma did not cross-react with the RBDs of SARS-CoV or Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), although there was substantial plasma cross-reactivity to their trimeric spike proteins.\n Analysis of the crystal structure of RBD-bound antibody revealed that steric hindrance inhibits viral engagement with ACE2, thereby blocking viral entry.\n These findings suggest that anti-RBD antibodies are largely viral-species-specific inhibitors.\n The antibodies identified here may be candidates for development of clinical interventions against SARS-CoV-2.\nIn a study of antibodies isolated from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, antibodies that potently neutralized the virus competed with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 for binding to the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein, suggesting that antibodies that disrupt this interaction could be developed to treat SARS-CoV-2
