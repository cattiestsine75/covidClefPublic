33 [66%] male) participated in the study.\n All tracheotomies were performed at the bedside.\n The median time from intubation to tracheotomy was 9 days (interquartile range, 2-24 days).\n A subthyroid approach was completed for 46 patients (92%), and the tracheal protocol was adequately achieved for 40 patients (80%).\n Adequate PPE was used, with no infection among surgeons identified 4 weeks after the last tracheotomy.\n Postoperative complications were rare, with minor bleeding (in 6 patients [12%]) being the most common complication.\n The successful weaning rate was higher in the early tracheotomy group than in the late tracheotomy group (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.55; 95% CI, 0.96-6.75), but the difference was not statistically significant.\n There was less time of invasive mechanical ventilatory support with early tracheotomy compared with late tracheotomy (mean [SD], 18 [5.4] vs 22.3 [5.7] days).\n The reduction of invasive ventilatory support was achieved at the expense of the pretracheotomy period.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, with the use of a standardized protocol aimed at minimizing COVID-19 risks, bedside open tracheotomy was a safe procedure for patients and surgeons, with minimal complications.\n Timing of tracheotomy may be important in reducing time of invasive mechanical ventilation, with potential implications to intensive care unit availability during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u003C\/p","id":"10.1001/jamaoto.2020.3641","idformat":"CORE","foundapis":"_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alobid","surname":"I","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Arancibia","surname":"C","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Avil\u00e9s-Jurado","surname":"FX","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bernal-Sprekelsen","surname":"M","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Castro","surname":"P","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"de","surname":"Oss\u00f3 J","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gonz\u00e1lez-S\u00e1nchez","surname":"N","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guilemany","surname":"JM","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jes\u00fas","surname":"Rojas-Lechuga M","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Langdon","surname":"C","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Larrosa","surname":"F","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lehrer-Coriat","surname":"E","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"L\u00f3pez-Chac\u00f3n","surname":"M","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Prieto","surname":"Alhambra D","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Remacha","surname":"J","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ruiz-Sevilla","surname":"L","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S\u00e1nchez","surname":"I","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                        Vilaseca","surname":"I","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamaoto.2020.4837","date":"2023-05-22","title":"'Early Outcomes From Early Tracheostomy for Patients With COVID-19'","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"10.1001/jamaoto.2020.4837","idformat":"CROSSREF","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"PUBLISHER: American Medical Association (AMA)","authors":[{"firstname":"Paul E.","surname":"Kwak","email":"xref no email","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Joseph R.","surname":"Connors","email":"xref no email","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Peter A.","surname":"Benedict","email":"xref no email","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Micah R.","surname":"Timen","email":"xref no email","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Binhuan","surname":"Wang","email":"xref no email","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Yan","surname":"Zhang","email":"xref no email","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Stephanie","surname":"Youlios","email":"xref no email","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Kimberly","surname":"Sureau","email":"xref no email","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Michael J.","surname":"Persky","email":"xref no email","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Samaan","surname":"Rafeq","email":"xref no email","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Luis","surname":"Angel","email":"xref no email","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"       Milan R.","surname":"Amin","email":"xref no email","contributions":"2"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.bja.2021.11.027","date":"2021-11-20","title":"Association between tracheostomy timing and outcomes for older critically ill COVID-19 patients: prospective observational study in European intensive care units","abstract":"Background\nTracheostomy is performed in patients expected to require prolonged mechanical ventilation, but to date optimal timing of tracheostomy has not been established.\n\n The evidence concerning tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients is particularly scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the relationship between early tracheostomy (?10 days since intubation) and outcomes for patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nThis was a prospective cohort study performed in 152 centres across 16 European countries from February to December 2020.

patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation","abstract":"Objectives\nTracheostomy for coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonitis patients requiring prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation remains a matter of debate.\n\n This study analysed the timing and outcomes of percutaneous tracheostomy, and reports our experience of a dedicated ENT–anaesthetics department led tracheostomy team.\n\n\nMethod\nA prospective single-centre observational study was conducted of patients undergoing tracheostomy, who had been diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonitis, between 21st March and 20th May 2020.\nResults\nEighty-one patients underwent tracheostomy after a median (interquartile range) of 16 (13–20) days of invasive mechanical ventilation.\n\n Median follow-up duration was 32 (23–40) days.\n\n Of patients, 86.7 per cent were successfully liberated from invasive mechanical ventilation in a median (interquartile range) of 12 (7–16) days.\n\n Moreover, 68.7 per cent were subsequently discharged from hospital.\n\n On univariate analysis, there was no difference in outcomes between early (before day 14) and late (day 14 or later) tracheostomy.\n\n The mortality rate was 8.6 per cent and no deaths were tracheostomy related.\n\n\nConclusion\nOutcomes appear favourable when patients are carefully selected.\n\n Percutaneous tracheostomy performed via a multidisciplinary approach, with appropriate training, was safe and optimised healthcare resource utilisation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7729174","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"A","surname":"Takhar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"C","surname":"Tornari","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"N","surname":"Amin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"D","surname":"Wyncoll","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S","surname":"Tricklebank","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"A","surname":"Arora","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"I","surname":"Ahmad","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"R","surname":"Simo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"
