coronavirus disease 2019 and influenza in Hong Kong: an observational study","abstract":"Background\nA range of public health measures have been implemented to suppress local transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong.\n\n We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioural changes of the public on the incidence of COVID-19, as well as on influenza virus infections, which might share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children.\n\n We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (Rt) for COVID-19 and influenza A H1N1 to estimate changes in transmissibility over time.\n\n Attitudes towards COVID-19 and changes in population behaviours were reviewed through three telephone surveys done on Jan 20–23, Feb 11–14, and March 10–13, 2020.\nFindings\nCOVID-19 transmissibility measured by Rt has remained at approximately 1 for 8 weeks in Hong Kong.\n\n Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% CI 34–53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, from an estimated Rt of 1·28 (95% CI 1·26–1·30) before the start of the school closures to 0·72 (0·70–0·74) during the closure weeks.\n\n Similarly, a 33% (24–43%) reduction in transmissibility was seen based on paediatric hospitalisation rates, from an Rt of 1·10 (1·06–1·12) before the start of the school closures to 0·73 (0·68–0·77) after school closures.\n\n Among respondents to the surveys, 74·5%, 97·5%, and 98·8% reported wearing masks when going out, and 61·3%, 90·2%, and 85·1% reported avoiding crowded places in surveys 1 (n=1008), 2 (n=1000), and 3 (n=1005), respectively.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur study shows that non-pharmaceutical interventions (including border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, distancing, and changes in population behaviour) were associated with reduced transmission of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, and are also likely to have substantially reduced influenza transmission in early February, 2020.\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund, Hong

used during the COVID-19 outbreak and describe the impact on seasonal influenza activity in Korea.\n\n\nMethods\nNational response strategies and public health interventions, along with daily COVID-19 confirmed cases in Korea were reviewed during the pandemic.\n\n National influenza surveillance data were compared between seven sequential seasons.\n\n Characteristics of each season, including the rate of influenza-like illness (ILI), duration of epidemic, date of termination of epidemic, distribution of influenza virus strain and hospitalization were analyzed.\n\n\nResults\nAfter various public health interventions including enforced public education on hand hygiene, cough etiquette and staying at home with respiratory symptoms, universal mask use in public places, refrain from non-essential social activities and school closure, the duration of the influenza epidemic in 2019/2020 decreased by 6-12 weeks and the influenza activity peak rated 49.8 ILI/1,000 visits compared to 71.9-86.2 ILI/1,000 visits of previous seasons.\n\n During the period of enforced social distancing from week 9 to 17 of 2020, influenza hospitalization cases were 11.9-26.9-fold lower compared with

Morbidity and Mortality ","abstract":"Seasonal influenza (flu) is an underappreciated source of disease morbidity and mortality worldwide. While vaccination remains the cornerstone of influenza prevention, common measures practiced during the COVID-19 pandemic such as social distancing, the use of protective face masks, and frequent hand washing are rarely utilized during flu season. In this investigation, we examined the effect of these preventative measures in decreasing influenza burden this year. We examined three countries with major COVID-19 outbreaks i.e. China, Italy and the United States, and compared the flu activity this year to the average of the last 4 years (2015-2019). We found that this year in China and Italy, there was a significantly steeper decline of flu cases than average, which correlated with an increase in positive COVID-19 case reports in those countries. These 'averted' cases can be translated into a substantial decrease in morbidity and mortality. As such, we conclude that the current COVID-19 pandemic is a reminder that behavioral measures can decrease the burden of communicable respiratory infections, and these measures should be adopted to an extent during normal influenza season.
