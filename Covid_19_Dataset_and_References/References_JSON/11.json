In order to follow biosafety recommendations, we used ultrasound?guided minimally invasive autopsy (MIA?US), and we present the results of 10 initial autopsies.\n\n\nMethods and results\nWe used MIA?US for tissue sampling of the lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, spleen, brain, skin, skeletal muscle and testis for histology, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA.\n\n All patients showed exudative/proliferative diffuse alveolar damage.\n\n There were intense pleomorphic cytopathic effects on the respiratory epithelium, including airway and alveolar cells.\n\n Fibrinous thrombi in alveolar arterioles were present in eight patients, and all patients showed a high density of alveolar megakaryocytes.\n\n Small thrombi were less frequently observed in the glomeruli, spleen, heart, dermis, testis, and liver sinusoids.\n\n The main systemic findings were associated with comorbidities, age, and sepsis, in addition to possible tissue damage due to the viral infection, such as myositis, dermatitis, myocarditis, and orchitis.\n\n\nConclusions\nMIA?US is safe and effective for the study of severe COVID?19. Our findings show that COVID?19 is a systemic disease causing major events in the lungs and with involvement of various organs and tissues.\n\n Pulmonary changes result from severe epithelial injury and microthrombotic vascular phenomena.\n\n These findings indicate that both epithelial and vascular injury should be addressed in therapeutic approaches.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7280721","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Amaro N","surname":"Duarte?Neto","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Renata A A","surname":"Monteiro","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Renata A A","surname":"Monteiro","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Luiz F F","surname":"da Silva","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Denise M A C","surname":"Malheiros","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ellen P","surname":"de Oliveira","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jair","surname":"Theodoro?Filho","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"João R R","surname":"Pinho","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michele S","surname":"Gomes?Gouvêa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ana P M","surname":"Salles","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ilka R S","surname":"de Oliveira","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thais","surname":"Mauad","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paulo H N","surname":"Saldiva","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                          Marisa","surname":"Dolhnikoff","email":"maridol@usp.br","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.8907","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Postmortem examination of patients with COVID-19","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"10.1001/jama.2020.8907","idformat":"CORE","foundapis":"_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Braun","surname":"Georg","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Burkhardt","surname":"Katrin","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Claus","surname":"Rainer","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hirschb\u00fchl","surname":"Klaus","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"M\u00e4rkl","surname":"Bruno","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Schaller","surname":"Tina","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                        Trepel","surname":"Martin","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.carpath.2020.107233","date":"2020-04-28","title":"The emerging spectrum of cardiopulmonary pathology of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Report of 3 autopsies from Houston, Texas, and review of autopsy findings from other United States cities","abstract":"\n\n\n•\nCOVID-19 is a viral disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.","id":"PMC7204762","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Louis Maximilian","surname":"Buja","email":"l.maximilian.buja@uth.tmc.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dwayne A.","surname":"Wolf","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bihong","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bindu","surname":"Akkanti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michelle","surname":"McDonald","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Lelenwa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Noah","surname":"Reilly","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Giulia","surname":"Ottaviani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"M.

This virus rapidly spread around the world causing disease ranging from minimal symptoms to severe pneumonia, which was termed coronavirus disease (i.\n\ne.\n\n, COVID).\n\n Postmortem examination is a valuable tool for studying the pathobiology of this new infection.\n\n\nMethods\nWe report the clinicopathologic findings from 32 autopsy studies conducted on patients who died of COVID-19 including routine gross and microscopic examination with applicable special and immunohistochemical staining techniques.\n\n\nResults\nSARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR in 31 cases (97%) and by immunohistochemical staining for SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein in the lung in the remaining 1 case (3%).\n\n The ethnically diverse cohort consisted of 22 males and 10 females with a mean age of 68 years (range: 30–100).\n\n Patients most commonly presented with cough (17 [55%]), shortness of breath (26 [81%]), and a low-grade fever (17 [55%]).\n\n Thirty-one (97%) of the patients had at least 1 comorbidity (mean = 4).\n\n Twenty-eight patients (88%) had widespread thromboembolic disease, as well as diffuse alveolar damage (30 [94%]), diabetic nephropathy (17 [57%]) and acute tubular injury.\n\n Patterns of liver injury were heterogeneous, featuring 10 (36%) with frequent large basophilic structures in sinusoidal endothelium, and increased immunoblast-like cells in lymph nodes.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis series of autopsies from patients with COVID-19 confirms the observation that the majority of severely affected patients have significant pulmonary pathology.\n\n However, many patients also have widespread microscopic thromboses, as well as characteristic findings in the liver and lymph nodes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7573917","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sarah S.","surname":"Elsoukkary","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maria","surname":"Mostyka","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alicia","surname":"Dillard","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Diana R.","surname":"Berman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lucy X.","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Amy","surname":"Chadburn","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rhonda K.","surname":"Yantiss","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jose","surname":"Jessurun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Surya V.","surname":"Seshan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alain C.","surname":"Borczuk","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                          Steven P.","surname":"Salvatore","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S2666-5247(20)30115-4","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Histopathological findings and viral tropism in UK patients with severe fatal COVID-19: a post-mortem study","abstract":"Background\nSevere COVID-19 has a high mortality rate.\n\n Comprehensive pathological descriptions of COVID-19 are scarce and limited in scope.\n\n We aimed to describe the histopathological findings and viral tropism in patients who died of severe COVID-19.\nMethods\nIn this case series, patients were considered eligible if they were older than 18 years, with premortem diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and COVID-19 listed clinically as the direct cause of death.\n\n Between March 1 and April 30, 2020, full post-mortem examinations were done on nine patients with confirmed COVID-19, including sampling of all major organs.\n\n A limited autopsy was done on one additional patient.\n\n Histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses were done, and histopathological findings were reported by subspecialist pathologists.\n\n Viral quantitative RT-PCR analysis was done on tissue samples from a subset of patients.\n\n\nFindings\nThe median age at death of our cohort of ten patients was 73 years (IQR 52–79).\n\n Thrombotic features were observed in at least one major organ in all full autopsies, predominantly in the lung (eight [89%] of nine patients), heart (five [56%]), and kidney (four [44%]).\n\n Diffuse alveolar damage was the most consistent lung finding (all ten patients); however, organisation was noted in patients with a longer clinical course.\n\n We documented lymphocyte depletion (particularly CD8-positive T cells) in haematological organs and haemophagocytosis.\n\n Evidence of acute tubular injury was noted in all nine patients examined.\n\n Major unexpected findings were acute pancreatitis (two [22%] of nine patients), adrenal micro-infarction (three [33%]), pericarditis (two [22%]), disseminated mucormycosis (one [10%] of ten patients), aortic dissection (one [11%] of nine patients), and marantic endocarditis (one [11%]).\n\n Viral genomes were detected outside of the respiratory tract in four of five patients.\n\n The presence of subgenomic viral RNA transcripts provided evidence of active viral replication outside the respiratory tract in three of five patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur series supports clinical data showing that the four dominant interrelated pathological processes in severe COVID-19 are diffuse alveolar damage, thrombosis, haemophagocytosis, and immune cell depletion.\n\n Additionally, we report here several novel autopsy findings including pancreatitis, pericarditis, adrenal micro-infarction, secondary disseminated mucormycosis, and brain microglial activation, which require additional investigation to understand their role in COVID-19.\nFunding\nImperial Biomedical Research Centre, Wellcome Trust, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7440861","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Brian","surname":"Hanley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kikkeri N","surname":"Naresh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Candice","surname":"Roufosse","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andrew G","surname":"Nicholson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Justin","surname":"Weir","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Graham S","surname":"Cooke","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Thursz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pinelopi","surname":"Manousou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Richard","surname":"Corbett","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Goldin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Safa","surname":"Al-Sarraj","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alireza","surname":"Abdolrasouli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Olivia C","surname":"Swann","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laury","surname":"Baillon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rebecca","surname":"Penn","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wendy S","surname":"Barclay","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Patrizia","surname":"Viola","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                          Michael","surname":"Osborn","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]}]}
