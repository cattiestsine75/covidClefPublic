Therefore, in order to mitigate the negative psychosocial effects of home confinement, implementation of national strategies focused on promoting social inclusion through a technology-based solution is strongly suggested.\n","id":"PMC7503681","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_Core_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Achraf","surname":"Ammar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

distress during lockdown following SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in type 1 diabetes","abstract":"Aims: To assess changes in glucose metrics and their association with psychological distress and lifestyle changes in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using flash glucose monitoring (FGM) during lockdown following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 outbreak.\n Materials and methods: Single-centre, observational, retrospective study enrolling T1D patients who attended a remote visit on April 2020 at the Endocrinology division of the University Hospital Policlinico Consorziale, Bari, Italy.\n Lockdown-related changes in physical activity level and dietary habits were assessed on a semi-quantitative basis.\n Changes in general well-being were assessed by the General Health Questionnaire-12 items with a binary scoring system.\n Glucose metrics were obtained from the Libreview platform for the first 2 weeks of February 2020 (T0) and the last 2 weeks before the phone visit (T1).\n Results: Out of 84 patients assessed for eligibility, 48 had sufficient FGM data to be included in the analysis.\n FGM data analysis revealed significant reductions in coefficient of variation, number of hypoglycaemic events, and time below range, while no changes were found in time in range, time above range, mean sensor glucose, and glucose management indicator.\n Moreover, the frequency of sweets consumption was inversely related to the occurrence of hypoglycaemic events during lockdown.\n Conclusions: Lockdown-related lifestyle changes, albeit unhealthy, may lead to reduction in FGM-derived measures of hypoglycaemia and glycaemic variability in patients with T1D","id":"10.1002/dmrr.3404","idformat":"CORE","foundapis":"_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Caruso","surname":"I.","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"

Confinement","abstract":"Background: The lockdown and social distancing caused by COVID-19 may influence common health behavior.\n The unprecedent worldwide confinement, in which Spain has been one of the most affected—with severe rules governing confinement—may have changed physical activity (PA) and sedentary habits due to prolonged stays at home.\n Purpose: The aim of this study is to evaluate how self-reported PA and sedentary time (ST) have changed during confinement in the Spanish population.\n Methods: 3800 healthy adults (age 18–64 years) residing in Spain answered the international physical activity questionnaire short (IPAQ-S) twice between 23 March and 1 April (confinement).\n Data analysis was carried out taking into consideration meeting general PA recommendations before confinement, age and gender.\n Results: Self-reported PA decreased significantly during confinement in our sample.\n Vigorous physical activities (VPA) and walking time decreased by 16.8% (p &lt; 0.001) and 58.2% (p &lt; 0.001), respectively, whereas ST increased by 23.8% (p &lt; 0.001).\n The percent of people fulfilling the 75 min/week of VPA recommendation decreased by 10.7% (p &lt; 0.001) while the percent of people who reached 150 min/week of moderate activity barely changed (1.4%).\n The group that performed the most VPA before confinement showed the greatest decrease (30.5%, p &lt; 0.001).\n Men reduced time in VPA more than women (21% vs 9%, respectively) who even increased time in moderate PA by 11% (p &lt; 0.05) and reported less increase in ST than men (35% vs 25.3%, respectively).\n Conclusion: The Spanish adult population, especially young people, students and very active men, decreased daily self-reported PA and increased ST during COVID-19 confinement.\n","id":"PMC7558959","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Arkaitz","surname":"Castañeda-Babarro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"
