Surgeon characteristics were recorded.\n\n The impact of COVID-19 on economic well-being, work, and mental health were also determined.\n\n All variables were compared and analyzed.\n\n\nResults:\nTwo hundred four surgeons answered the complete survey; most of them were male (96.6%), the average age was 47.7 years; 58.8% (n = 120) were orthopedic surgeons and 41.2% (n = 84) were neurosurgeons.\n\n The majority of the respondents were from Argentina (59.8%, n = 122), followed by Brazil (17.2%, n = 35), Chile (6.4%, n = 13), and Mexico (5.9%, n = 12).\n\n Most of the surgeons reported performing emergency procedures only during the pandemic (76.5%, n = 156).\n\n Half used telemedicine or online consultation modalities (54.4%, n = 111).\n\n The average concern about the financial situation due to the pandemic was 7.53 in a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the worst scenario).\n\n Twenty-two percent (n = 45) of the surgeons had a score over 10 in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; scores higher than 10 needs referral to confirm depression diagnosis).\n\n Young age and neurosurgery as a specialty were associated with higher PHQ-9 scores.\n\n\nConclusions:\nCOVID-19 has an impact in the daily working practice and financial situation of spine surgeons in Latin America.\n\n The long-term psychological impact should be taken into consideration to avoid a heavier burden for health care providers.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8258821","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alfredo","surname":"Guiroy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Martín","surname":"Gagliardi","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Martín","surname":"Gagliardi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicolas","surname":"Coombes","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Federico","surname":"Landriel","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Federico","surname":"Landriel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Carlos","surname":"Zanardi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gastón

cross-sectional survey was completed by HCWs across three regions (Hubei, Guangdong, Hong Kong) between March 9 to April 9 2020 using convenience sampling.\n\n Depression was assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).\n\n Prevalence of depression was 50.4% (95% CI: 44.5-56.2), 15.1% (10.1-21.9) and 12.9% (10.3-16.2) for HCWs in Hong Kong, Hubei and Guangdong, respectively.\n\n The strongest significant risk factors for depression, after adjustment, were HCWs who reported the greatest extent of feeling susceptible to contracting COVID-19 and those who reported the greatest difficulty obtaining face masks.\n\n HCWs whose family/peers greatly encouraged face mask use had lower prevalence of depression.\n\n Access to adequate supplies of personal protective equipment is

COVID-19.\nMethods\nIn a web-based cross-sectional study, 441 nurses working were selected from the hospitals, from 7 to 12 April 2020. Anxiety and depression were measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, respectively.\n\n Simple and multiple logistic regression models were used to identify the factors related to anxiety and depression.\n\n\nResults\nThe majority were in contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases (93.4%) and their relatives had been infected with COVID-19 (42%).\n\n The mean of anxiety-7 and depression total scores were 8.64 ± 5.60 and 8.48 ± 6.19, respectively.\n\n Female (OR = 3.27, 95% CI = 1.0110.64), working in COVID-19 designated hospital (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.132.93), being suspected with COVID-19 infection (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.253.26), and insufficient personal protective equipment (OR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.684.06) were associated with anxiety.\n\n Depression was significantly associated with female sex (OR = 4.62, %95 CI = 1.2417.16), having chronic disease (OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.203.74), being suspected or confirmed with COVID-19 infection (OR = 3.44, 95% CI = 2.115.59, and OR = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.044.70, respectively), and insufficient personal protective equipment (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.192.91).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe finding declares healthcare workers are at high risk for mental illness.\n\n Continuous supervision of the psychological consequences following infectious diseases outbreaks should be a part of the preparedness efforts of health care systems.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7417274","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Moluk","surname":"Pouralizadeh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zahra","surname":"Bostani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Saman","surname":"Maroufizadeh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Atefeh","surname":"Ghanbari","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maryam","surname":"Khoshbakht","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Seyed

a cross-sectional study in China","abstract":"Background\nHealthcare workers fighting against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are under tremendous pressure, which puts them at an increased risk of developing psychological problems.\n\n\nAims\nThis study aimed to investigate the prevalence of psychological problems in different healthcare workers (ie, physicians, medical residents, nurses, technicians and public health professionals) during the COVID-19 pandemic in China and explore factors that are associated with the onset of psychological problems in this population during this public health crisis.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted in February 2020 among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n Psychological problems were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire and Insomnia Severity Index.\n\n Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the factors that were associated with psychological problems.\n\n\nResults\nThe prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia and the overall psychological problems in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China was 46.04%, 44.37%, 28.75% and 56.59%, respectively.\n\n The prevalence of the overall psychological problems in physicians, medical residents, nurses, technicians and public health professionals was 60.35%, 50.82%, 62.02%, 57.54% and 62.40%, respectively.\n\n Compared with healthcare workers who did not participate in front-line work, front-line healthcare workers had a higher risk of anxiety, insomnia and overall psychological problems.\n\n In addition, attention to negative or neutral information about the pandemic, receiving negative feedback from families and friends who joined front-line work, and unwillingness to join front-line work if given a free choice were three major factors for these psychological problems.\n\n\nConclusions\nPsychological problems are pervasive among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n Receiving negative information and participating in front-line work appear to be important risk factors for psychological problems.\n\n The psychological health of different healthcare workers should be protected during the COVID-19 pandemic with timely interventions and proper information feedback.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7299004","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jianyu","surname":"Que","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Le","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Le","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiahui","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiajia","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suying","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yimiao","surname":"Gong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Weizhen","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kai","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yankun","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maosheng","surname":"Ran","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Bao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

is witnessed in the past epidemics. Infectious diseases outbreaks like the ongoing COVID19 pandemic have negative impact on healthcare workers (HCWs) mental health, which needs to be investigated. Therefore, we aimed to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 on frontline HCWs and their coping strategies.\n\nMethodsA web-based, cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs of the Punjab province of Pakistan. The generalized anxiety scale (GAD-7), patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Brief-COPE were used to assess anxiety, depression and coping strategies.\n\nResultsThe mean age of respondents (N = 398) was 28.67 {+/-} 4.15 years, with majority of medical doctors (52%). The prevalence of anxiety and depression were 21.4% and 21.9%, respectively. There was no significant difference of anxiety and depression scores among doctors, nurses and pharmacists. Females had significantly higher anxiety (p = 0.003) and depression (p = 0.001) scores than males. Moreover, HCWs performing duties in COVID-19 ICU had significantly higher anxiety score than those from isolation wards (p = 0.020) and other departments (p = 0.014). Depression, not anxiety, score were higher among those who did not receive the infection prevention training. Most frequently adopted coping strategy was religious coping (5.98 {+/-} 1.73) followed by acceptance (5.59 {+/-} 1.55) and coping planning (4.91 {+/-} 1.85).\n\nConclusionA considerable proportion of HCWs are having generalized anxiety and depression during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings call for interventions to mitigate mental health risks in HCWs.

brought enormous physical and psychological pressure on Chinese medical staff.\n\n It is extremely important to understand the prevalence and influencing factors of anxiety and depression symptoms in first-line anti-epidemic medical staff and their coping styles for these negative emotions.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted in Gansu (China), with a questionnaire packet which consisted of the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and the simplified coping style questionnaire (SCSQ).\n\n A total of 79 doctors and 86 nurses participated in the survey.\n\n Correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationship between SAS, SDS, and SCSQ score.\n\n A linear regression model was used to determine the influencing factors for anxiety or depression symptoms.\n\n\nResults\nThe prevalence rates of anxiety and depression symptoms among doctors was 11.4% and 45.6%, respectively.\n\n History of depression or anxiety (T=-2.644, p= 0.010, 95%CI: -10.514~-1.481) was shown to be a risk factor for anxiety symptoms in doctors, while being male (T=2.970, p=0.004, 95%CI: 2.667~13.521) was a protective factor for depression.\n\n The prevalence rate of anxiety and depression symptoms among nurses was 27.9% and 43.0%, respectively.\n\n History of depression or anxiety was a common risk factor for anxiety symptoms (T=-3.635, p=0.000, 95%CI: -16.360~-4.789) and depression symptoms (T=-2.835, p=0.005, 95%CI:-18.238~-3.254) in nurses.\n\n The results of partial correlation analysis (controlled for gender and history of

web-based cross-sectional survey on a sample of Italian general practitioners","abstract":"Background:\nSince the World Health Organization declared the new 2019 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak first a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and then a pandemic, Italy held more than 195.350 cases and 26.380 deaths.\n\n Working in the frontline with suspected Covid-19 infection patients, general practitioners (GPs) are daily under both physical and psychological pressure.\n\n\nMethods:\nA web-based cross-sectional survey was carried out on italian GPs working in Genoa (Italy), to assess the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on mental health.\n\n The survey was anonymous and a free Google Forms® software was used.\n\n\nResults:\nOne hundred thirty-one GPs completed the survey.\n\n Compared to GPs with absent or mild depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 &lt; 10), GPs reporting moderate to severe depressive symptoms (N=30, 22.9%; PHQ-9 ? 10) reported more helplessness (96.7% vs.\n\n 79.2%, p=.\n\n025), spent more than three hours searching for COVID-19 information (43.3% vs.\n\n 19.8%, p=.\n\n024), perceived less adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) (6.7% vs.\n\n 23.8%, p=.\n\n049) and visited more COVID-19 infected patients (16.63 ± 27.30 vs.\n\n 9.52 ± 11.75, p=.\n\n041).\n\n Moreover, PHQ-9 ? 10 GPs reported a significant higher severity for both anxiety and insomnia (13.43 ± 4.96 vs.\n\n 4.88 ± 3.53 and 11.60 ± 5.53 vs.\n\n 4.84 ± 3.81, respectively; p&lt;.\n\n001), and a worse quality of life in both mental (34.60 ± 7.45 vs.\n\n 46.01 ± 7.83, p&lt;.\n\n001) and physical (43.50 ± 9.37 vs.\n\n 52.94 ± 4.78, p&lt;.\n\n001) component summary.\n\n\nConclusions:\nOur results give early insight into the urgent need to provide continuity of care for patients at the community-level, adequate PPE to GPs and a clear guidance from public health institutions.\n\n A precarious healthcare system both at a national and regional level might have triggered negative mental health outcomes in Italian GPs.\n\n

post-traumatic stress disorder in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","abstract":"Objective\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has placed health care workers under psychological stress.\n\n Previous reviews show a high prevalence of mental disorders among health care workers, but these need updating and inclusion of studies written in Chinese.\n\n The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to provide updated prevalence estimates for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, benefitting from the inclusion of studies published in Chinese.\n\n\nMethods\nSystematic search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Global Health, Web of Science, CINAHL, Google Scholar and the Chinese databases SinoMed, WanfangMed, CNKI and CQVIP, for studies conducted between December 2019 and August 2020 on the prevalence of depression, anxiety and PTSD in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n Studies published in both English and Chinese were included.\n\n\nResults\nData on the prevalence of moderate depression, anxiety and PTSD was pooled across 65 studies involving 97,333 health care workers across 21 countries.\n\n The pooled prevalence of depression was 21.7% (95% CI, 18.3%-25.2%), of anxiety 22.1% (95% CI, 18.2%-26.3%), and of PTSD 21.5% (95% CI, 10.5%-34.9%).\n\n Prevalence estimates are also provided for a mild classification of each disorder.\n\n Pooled prevalence estimates of depression and anxiety were highest in studies conducted in the Middle-East (34.6%; 28.9%).\n\n Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted across covariates, including sampling method and outcome measure.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis has identified a high prevalence of moderate depression, anxiety and PTSD among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n Appropriate support is urgently needed.\n\n The response would benefit from additional research on which interventions are effective at mitigating these risks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7946321","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yufei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nathaniel","surname":"Scherer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lambert","surname":"Felix","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lambert","surname":"Felix","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hannah","surname":"Kuper","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hannah","surname":"Kuper","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jakob","surname":"Pietschnig","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"
