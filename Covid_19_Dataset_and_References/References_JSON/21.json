patients with COVID-19, and determine the correlation of serum N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and cardiac troponin-I (cTnI) with the severity of COVID-19, and the impact of concomitant cardiovascular disease on severity of COVID-19 was also evaluated.\n Methods: A cross-sectional study was designed on 150 consecutive patients with COVID-19 in the fever clinic of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January to February in 2020, including 126 mild cases and 24 cases in critical care.\n Both univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the correlation of past medical history including hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD) , as well as the levels of serum NT-proBNP and cTnI to the disease severity of COVID-19 patients.\n Results: Age, hypersensitive C-reactive protein(hs-CRP) and serum creatinine levels of the patients were higher in critical care cases than in mild cases(all P<0.05).\n Prevalence of male, elevated NT-proBNP and cTnI, hypertension and coronary heart disease were significantly higher in critical cases care patients than in the mild cases(all P<0.05).\n Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, male, elevated NT-proBNP, elevated cTnI, elevated hs-CRP, elevated serum creatinine, hypertension, and CHD were significantly correlated with critical disease status(all P<0.05).\n Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that elevated cTnI(OR=26.909, 95%CI 4.086-177.226, P=0.001) and CHD (OR=16.609, 95%CI 2.288-120.577, P=0.005) were the independent risk factors of critical disease status.\n Conclusions: COVID-19 can significantly affect the heart function and lead to myocardial injury.\n The past medical history of CHD and increased level of cTnI are two independent determinants of clinical disease status in patients with COVID-19.","id":"10.3760/cma.j.cn112148-20200225-00123","idformat":"ELASTIC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"

recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry

Although diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure were the main features, the involvement of other organs needs to be explored.\n\n Since information on kidney disease in patients with COVID-19 is limited, we determined the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19. Further, we evaluated the association between markers of abnormal kidney function and death in patients with COVID-19. This was a prospective cohort study of 701 patients with COVID-19 admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital that also encompassed three affiliates following this major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020 of whom 113 (16.1%) died in hospital.\n\n Median age of the patients was 63 years (interquartile range, 50-71), including 367 men and 334 women.\n\n On admission, 43.9% of patients had proteinuria and 26.7% had hematuria.\n\n The prevalence of elevated serum creatinine, elevated blood urea nitrogen and estimated glomerular filtration under 60 ml/min/1.73m2 were 14.4, 13.1 and 13.1%, respectively.\n\n During the study period, AKI occurred in 5.1% patients.\n\n Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney disease had a significantly higher risk for in-hospital death.\n\n Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated baseline serum creatinine (hazard ratio: 2.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.36-3.26), elevated baseline blood urea nitrogen (3.97, 2.57-6.14), AKI stage 1 (1.90, 0.76-4.76), stage 2 (3.51, 1.49-8.26), stage 3 (4.38, 2.31-8.31), proteinuria 1+ (1.80, 0.81-4.00), 2+?3+ (4.84, 2.00-11.70), and hematuria 1+ (2.99, 1.39-6.42), 2+?3+ (5.56,2.58- 12.01) were independent risk factors for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, comorbidity and leukocyte count.\n\n Thus, our findings show the prevalence of kidney disease on admission and the development of AKI during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 is high and is associated with in-hospital mortality.\n\n Hence, clinicians should increase their awareness of kidney disease in patients with severe COVID-19.","id":"PMC7110296","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yichun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ran","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kun","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Meng","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhixiang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Dong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Junhua","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Yao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shuwang","surname":"Ge","email":"geshuwang@tjh.tjmu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                          Gang","surname":"Xu","email":"xugang@tjh.tjmu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jemermed.2020.04.004","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"","id":"PMC7266766","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Carly","surname":"Eastin","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"                          Travis","surname":"Eastin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0950","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Propuesta de adecuaci\u00f3n  de los protocolos de actuaci\u00f3n en cardiolog\u00eda intervencionista durante la COVID-19","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0950","idformat":"CORE","foundapis":"_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Aguilar","surname":"Medina Jos\u00e9 M.","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":"Claro","surname":"Vald\u00e9s Ram\u00f3n","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Obreg\u00f3n","surname":"Santos Angel G.","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Proh\u00edas","surname":"Mart\u00ednez Juan","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"                        Rodr\u00edguez","surname":"Blanco Suilbert","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"2"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/ijms21093275","date":"2020-04-29","title":"Acute Kidney Injury in SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Direct Effect of Virus on Kidney Proximal Tubule Cells","abstract":"","id":"PMC7247357","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Manoocher","surname":"Soleimani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1159/000507471","date":"2020-03-24","title":"Coronavirus Disease 19 Infection Does Not Result in Acute Kidney Injury: An Analysis of 116 Hospitalized Patients from Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nWhether the patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 would commonly develop acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important issue worthy of clinical attention.\n\n This study aimed to explore the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function through analyzing the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients.\n\n\nMethods\nOne hundred sixteen COVID-19-confirmed patients enrolled in this study were hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 14 to February 13, 2020.
