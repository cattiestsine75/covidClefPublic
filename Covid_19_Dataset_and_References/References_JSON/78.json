Hospital in Wuhan, China.\n\n\nParticipants\nAmong a cohort of 799 patients, 113 who died and 161 who recovered with a diagnosis of covid-19 were analysed.\n\n Data were collected until 28 February 2020.\nMain outcome measures\nClinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years).\n\n Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%).\n\n Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)).\n\n Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62%), 55 (49%), and 25 (22%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%), 48 (30%), and 1 (1%)).\n\n The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days.\n\n Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50%) patients who died and 6 (4%) who recovered, and lymphopenia was present in 103 (91%)

cumulative number of new confirmed cases and deaths are still increasing out of China.\n\n Independent predicted factors associated with fatal outcomes remain uncertain.\n\n\nResearch Question\nThe goal of the current study was to investigate the potential risk factors associated with fatal outcomes from COVID-19 through a multivariate Cox regression analysis and a nomogram model.\n\n\nStudy Design and Methods\nA retrospective cohort of 1,590 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 throughout China was established.\n\n The prognostic effects of variables, including clinical features and laboratory findings, were analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier methods and a Cox proportional hazards model.\n\n A prognostic nomogram was formulated to predict the survival of patients with COVID-19.\nResults\nIn this nationwide cohort, nonsurvivors included a higher incidence of elderly people and subjects with coexisting chronic illness, dyspnea, and laboratory abnormalities on admission compared with survivors.\n\n Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age ? 75 years (hazard ratio [HR], 7.86; 95% CI, 2.44-25.35), age between 65 and 74 years (HR, 3.43; 95% CI,

based on the results of multivariate analysis.\n\n The internal bootstrap resampling approach suggested the nomogram has sufficient discriminatory power with a C-index of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.85-0.97).\n\n The calibration plots also showed good consistency between the prediction and the observation.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe proposed nomogram accurately predicted clinical outcomes of patients with

various digestive symptoms have been frequently reported in patients infected with the virus.\n\n In this study, we aimed to further investigate the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms.\n\n\nMETHODS:\nIn this descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study, we enrolled confirmed patients with COVID-19 who presented to 3 hospitals from January 18, 2020, to February 28, 2020. All patients were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and were analyzed for clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and treatment.\n\n Data were followed up until March 18, 2020.\nRESULTS:\nIn the present study, 204 patients with COVID-19 and full laboratory, imaging, and historical data were analyzed.\n\n The average age was 52.9 years (SD ± 16), including 107 men and 97 women.\n\n Although most patients presented to the hospital with fever or respiratory symptoms, we found that 103 patients (50.5%) reported a digestive symptom, including lack of appetite (81 [78.6%] cases), diarrhea (35 [34%] cases), vomiting (4 [3.9%] cases), and abdominal pain (2 [1.9%] cases).\n\n If lack of appetite is excluded from the analysis (because it is less specific for the gastrointestinal tract), there were 38 total cases (18.6%) where patients presented with a gastrointestinal-specific symptom, including diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.\n\n Patients with digestive symptoms had a significantly longer time from onset to admission than patients without digestive symptoms (9.0 days vs 7.3 days).\n\n In 6 cases, there were digestive symptoms, but no respiratory symptoms.\n\n As the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more pronounced.\n\n Patients with digestive symptoms had higher mean liver enzyme levels, lower monocyte count, longer prothrombin time, and received more antimicrobial treatment than those without digestive symptoms.\n\n\nDISCUSSION:\nWe found that digestive symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, these patients have a longer time from onset to admission, evidence of longer coagulation, and higher liver enzyme levels.\n\n Clinicians should recognize that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, are commonly among the presenting features of COVID-19 and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms.\n\n However, further large sample studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7172492","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mi","surname":"Mu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pengcheng","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Runsheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junhong","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pibao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Baoguang","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xun","surname":"Niu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rongyu","surname":"Ping","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yingzhen","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tianzhi","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guogang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qinyong","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"                            Lei","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/jgs.16533","date":"2020-04-14","title":"Risk Factors for Mortality in 244 Older Adults With <styled-content style='fixed-case' toggle='no'>COVID</styled-content>?19 in Wuhan, China: A Retrospective Study","abstract":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES\nPrevious studies have reported that older patients may experience worse outcome(s) after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus?2 than younger individuals.\n\n This study aimed to identify potential risk factors for mortality in older patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) on admission, which may help identify those with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n\nDESIGN\nRetrospective case?control.\n\n\nSETTING\nFever ward of Sino?French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nPatients aged 60?years or older with COVID?19 (n = 244) were included, of whom 123 were discharged and 121 died in hospital.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS\nData retrieved from electronic medical records regarding symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings on admission, and final outcomes of all older patients with COVID?19, were retrospectively reviewed.\n\n Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore risk factors for death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nUnivariate analysis revealed that several clinical characteristics and laboratory variables were significantly different (ie, P?&lt;?.\n\n05) between discharged and deceased patients.\n\n Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that lymphocyte (LYM) count (odds ratio [OR] =?0.009; 95% confidence interval [CI] =?0.001?0.138; P = .\n\n001) and older age (OR = 1.122; 95% CI = 1.007?1.249; P = .\n\n037) were independently associated with hospital mortality.\n\n White blood cell count was also an important risk factor (P = .\n\n052).\n\n The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the logistic regression model was 0.913.

posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples and serum antibody responses during infection by SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks.\n\n Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available.\n\n Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk.\n\n We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong.\n\n We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs.\n\n Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).\n\n Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA.\n\n Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 3775]).\n\n The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5·2 log10 copies per mL (IQR 4·17·0).\n\n Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope ?0·15, 95% CI ?0·19 to ?0·11; R2=0·71).\n\n In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset.\n\n Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's ?=0·48, 95% CI 0·0740·75; p=0·020).\n\n For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15).\n\n Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R2&gt;0·9).\n\n No genome mutations were detected on serial samples.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPosterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers.\n\n Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic.\n\n This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals.\n\n Serological assay can complement RT-qPCR for diagnosis.\n\n\nFunding\nRichard and Carol Yu, May Tam Mak Mei Yin, The Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Tong, Marina Lee, Government Consultancy Service, and Sanming Project of Medicine.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158907","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kelvin Kai-Wang","surname":"To","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Owen Tak-Yin","surname":"Tsang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wai-Shing","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anthony Raymond","surname":"Tam","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tak-Chiu","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David Christopher","surname":"Lung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cyril Chik-Yan","surname":"Yip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-Piao","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jacky Man-Chun","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas Shiu-Hong","surname":"Chik","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daphne Pui-Ling","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chris Yau-Chung","surname":"Choi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lin-Lei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wan-Mui","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Hung","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan Daniel","surname":"Ip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anthony Chin-Ki","surname":"Ng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rosana Wing-Shan","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cui-Ting","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vincent Chi-Chung","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jasper Fuk-Woo","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ivan Fan-Ngai","surname":"Hung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhiwei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Honglin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"                            Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/bjh.16659","date":"2020-03-22","title":"Relationships among lymphocyte subsets, cytokines, and the pulmonary inflammation index in coronavirus (COVID?19) infected patients","abstract":"We explored the relationships between lymphocyte subsets, cytokines, pulmonary inflammation index (PII) and disease evolution in patients with (corona virus disease 2019) COVID?19.
