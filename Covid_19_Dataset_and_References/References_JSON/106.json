In total, this included 18 patients over this time period.\n\n\nResults\nIn total, 18 patients were managed with extracorporeal support and of these 14 survived (78%) with 4 deaths (22%).\n\n The mean duration from hospital admission to intubation was 4.1 ± 3.4 days, mean time from intubation to ECMO 2.3 ± 2 days and mean run on ECMO 17.7 ± 9.4 days.\n\n Survivor mean days from intubation to extubation was 20.6 ± 9.9 days and survivor mean days from intubation to tracheostomy decannulation 46.6 ± 15.3 days.\n\n Time from hospital admission to discharge in survivors was a mean of 57.2 ± 25.8 days.\n\n Of the patients requiring extracorporeal support, the initial mode was veno-venous (VV) in 15 (83%), veno-arterial (VA) in 2 (11%) and veno-venous-arterial (VVA) in 1 (6%).\n\n On VV extracorporeal support, 2 (11%) required additional VVA.\n\n Renal replacement therapy was required in 10 (56%) of the patients.\n\n Anticoagulation target anti-Xa of 0.2–0.4 was set, with 10 (56%) patients having a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism detected and 2 (11%) patients suffering an intracranial haemorrhage.\n\n Tracheostomy was performed in 9 (50%) of the patients and high-dose methylprednisolone was given to 7 (39%) of the patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn our cohort of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 respiratory failure, a long period of invasive ventilation and extracorporeal support was required but achieving good outcomes despite this.\n\n There was a significant burden of thromboembolic disease and renal injury.\n\n A significant proportion of patients required tracheostomy and steroids to facilitate weaning.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7683277","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_Springer_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Waqas","surname":"Akhtar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

an international cohort study of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry","abstract":"Background\nMultiple major health organisations recommend the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support for COVID-19-related acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure.\n\n However, initial reports of ECMO use in patients with COVID-19 described very high mortality and there have been no large, international cohort studies of ECMO for COVID-19 reported to date.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used data from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry to characterise the epidemiology, hospital course, and outcomes of patients aged 16 years or older with confirmed COVID-19 who had ECMO support initiated between Jan 16 and May 1, 2020, at 213 hospitals in 36 countries.\n\n The primary outcome was in-hospital death in a time-to-event analysis assessed at 90 days after ECMO initiation.\n\n We applied a multivariable Cox model to examine whether patient and hospital factors were associated with in-hospital mortality.\n\n\nFindings\nData for 1035 patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO support were included in this study.\n\n Of these, 67 (6%) remained hospitalised, 311 (30%) were discharged home or to an acute rehabilitation centre, 101 (10%) were discharged to a long-term acute care centre or unspecified location, 176 (17%) were discharged to another hospital, and 380 (37%) died.\n\n The estimated cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality 90 days after the initiation of ECMO was 37·4% (95% CI 34·4–40·4).\n\n Mortality was 39% (380 of 968) in patients with a final disposition of death or hospital discharge.\n\n The use of ECMO for circulatory support was independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio 1·89, 95% CI 1·20–2·97).\n\n In the subset of patients with COVID-19 receiving respiratory (venovenous) ECMO and characterised as having acute respiratory distress syndrome, the estimated cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality 90 days after the initiation of ECMO was 38·0% (95% CI 34·6–41·5).\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO, both estimated mortality 90 days after ECMO and mortality in those with a final disposition of death or discharge were less than 40%.\n\n These data from 213 hospitals worldwide provide a generalisable estimate of ECMO mortality in the setting of COVID-19.\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7518880","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ryan

Patients With COVID-19","abstract":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with high mortality.\n\n It has been suggested that venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was suitable in this indication, albeit the effects of ECMO on the mechanical respiratory parameters have been scarcely described.\n\n In this case-series, we prospectively described the use of venovenous ECMO and its effects on mechanical respiratory parameters in eleven COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS.\n\n Implantation of ECMO occurred 6 [3–11] days after the onset of mechanical ventilation.\n\n At the time of ECMO implantation, all patients received neuromuscular blocking agents, three (27%) received inhaled nitric oxide and prone positioning was performed in all patients with 4 [3?5] sessions of PP per patient.\n\n Under ECMO, the tidal volume was significantly decreased from 6.1 [4.0–6.3] to 3.4 [2.5–3.6] mL/kg of predicted body weight and the positive end-expiratory pressure level was increased by 25 ± 27% whereas the driving pressure and the mechanical power decreased by 33 ± 25% and 71 ± 27%, respectively.\n\n The PaO2/FiO2 ratio significantly increased from 68 [58–89] to 168 [137–218] and the oxygenation index significantly decreased from 28 [26–35] to 13 [10–15].\n\n The duration of ECMO was 12 [8–25] days.\n\n Nine (82%) patients experienced ECMO-related complications and the main complication was major bleeding requiring blood transfusions.\n\n Intensive care unit mortality rate was 55% but no patient died from ECMO-related complications.\n\n In COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS, venovenous ECMO allowed ultra-protective ventilation, improved oxygenation and should be considered in highly selected patients with the most severe ARDS.\n\n","id":"PMC7758460","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mathieu","surname":"Jozwiak","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

(MV).\n\n High mortality (50–97%) was proposed by some groups, leading to considerable uncertainties with regard to outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19.\nObjectives\nThe aim was to investigate the characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and MV.\n\n\nMethods\nA multicentre retrospective observational cohort study at 15 hospitals in Hamburg, Germany, was performed.\n\n Critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 who completed their ICU stay between February and June 2020 were included.\n\n Patient demographics, severity of illness, and ICU course were retrospectively evaluated.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 223 critically ill patients with COVID-19 were included.\n\n The majority, 73% (n = 163), were men; the median age was 69 (interquartile range = 58–77.5) years, with 68% (n = 151) patients having at least one chronic medical condition.\n\n Their Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was a median of 5 (3–9) points on admission.\n\n Overall, 167 (75%) patients needed MV.\n\n Noninvasive ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula were used in 31 (14%) and 26 (12%) patients, respectively.\n\n Subsequent MV, due to noninvasive ventilation/high-flow nasal cannula therapy failure, was necessary in 46 (81%) patients.\n\n Renal replacement therapy was initiated in 33% (n = 72) of patients, and owing to severe respiratory failure, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was necessary in 9% (n = 20) of patients.\n\n Experimental antiviral therapy was used in 9% (n = 21) of patients.\n\n Complications during the ICU stay were as follows: septic shock (40%, n = 90), heart failure (8%, n = 17), and pulmonary embolism (6%, n = 14).\n\n The length of ICU stay was a median of 13 days (5–24), and the duration of MV was 15 days (8–25).\n\n The ICU mortality was 35% (n = 78) and 44% (n = 74) among mechanically ventilated patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn this multicentre observational study of 223 critically ill patients with COVID-19, the survival to ICU discharge was 65%, and it was 56% among patients requiring MV.\n\n Patients showed high rate of septic
