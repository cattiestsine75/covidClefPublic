had either a positive COVID-19 test at least 14 days after their first vaccination (but before their second; cases 1) or a positive test at least 7 days after their second vaccination (cases 2); and had no positive test before vaccination.\n\n Two control groups were selected (who also had not tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before vaccination): users reporting a negative test at least 14 days after their first vaccination but before their second (controls 1) and users reporting a negative test at least 7 days after their second vaccination (controls 2).\n\n Controls 1 and controls 2 were matched (1:1) with cases 1 and cases 2, respectively, by the date of the post-vaccination test, health-care worker status, and sex.\n\n In the disease profile analysis, we sub-selected participants from cases 1 and cases 2 who had used the app for at least 14 consecutive days after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 3 and cases 4, respectively).\n\n Controls 3 and controls 4 were unvaccinated participants reporting a positive SARS-CoV-2 test who had used the app for at least 14 consecutive days after the test, and were matched (1:1) with cases 3 and 4, respectively, by the date of the positive test, health-care worker status, sex, body-mass index (BMI), and age.\n\n We used univariate logistic regression models (adjusted for age, BMI, and sex) to analyse the associations between risk factors and post-vaccination infection, and the associations of individual symptoms, overall disease duration, and disease severity with vaccination status.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Dec 8, 2020, and July 4, 2021, 1?240?009 COVID Symptom Study app users reported a first vaccine dose, of whom 6030 (0·5%) subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 1), and 971?504 reported a second dose, of whom 2370 (0·2%) subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 2).\n\n In the risk factor analysis, frailty was associated with post-vaccination infection in older adults (?60 years) after their first vaccine dose (odds ratio [OR] 1·93, 95% CI 1·50–2·48; p&lt;0·0001), and individuals living in highly deprived areas had increased odds of post-vaccination infection following their first vaccine dose (OR 1·11, 95% CI 1·01–1·23; p=0·039).\n\n Individuals without obesity (BMI &lt;30 kg/m2) had lower odds of infection following their first vaccine dose (OR 0·84, 95% CI 0·75–0·94; p=0·0030).\n\n For the disease profile analysis, 3825 users from cases 1 were included in cases 3 and 906 users from cases 2 were included in cases 4. Vaccination (compared with no vaccination) was associated with reduced odds of hospitalisation or having more than five symptoms in the first week of illness following the first or second dose, and long-duration (?28 days) symptoms following the second dose.\n\n Almost all symptoms were reported less frequently in infected vaccinated individuals than in infected unvaccinated individuals, and vaccinated participants were more likely to be completely asymptomatic, especially if they were 60 years or older.\n\n\nInterpretation\nTo minimise SARS-CoV-2 infection, at-risk populations must be targeted in efforts to boost vaccine effectiveness and infection control measures.\n\n Our findings might support caution around relaxing physical distancing and other personal protective measures in the post-vaccination era, particularly around frail older adults and individuals living in more deprived areas, even if these individuals are vaccinated, and might have implications for strategies such as booster vaccinations.\n\n\nFunding\nZOE, the UK Government Department of Health and Social Care, the Wellcome Trust, the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, UK Research and

in children is a major issue.\n\n Children often present mild symptoms, and some severe forms require paediatric intensive care, with in some cases a fatal prognosis.\n\n Our aim was to identify the epidemiological characteristics, clinical presentation, and prognosis of children with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) hospitalized in Paris suburb hospitals.\n\n In this prospective, observational, multicentre study, we included children hospitalized in paediatric departments of Paris suburb hospitals from 23 March 2020 to 10 May 2020, during the national lockdown in France with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive RNA test on a nasopharyngeal swab) or highly suspected infection (clinical, biological, and/or radiological data features suggestive for SARS-CoV-2 infection).\n\n A total of 192 children were included for confirmed (n = 157) or highly suspected (n = 35) SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n The median age was one year old (interquartile range 0.125–11) with a sex ratio 1.3:1. Fever was recorded in 147 (76.6%) children and considered poorly tolerated in 29 (15.1%).\n\n The symptoms ranged from rhinorrhoea (34.4%) and gastrointestinal (35.5%) to respiratory distress (25%).\n\n Only 10 (5.2%) children had anosmia and five (2.6%) had chest pain.\n\n An underlying condition was identified in almost 30% of the children in our study.\n\n Overall, 24 (12.5%) children were admitted to paediatric intensive care units, 12 required mechanical ventilation, and three died.\n\n For children in Paris suburbs, most cases of Covid-19 showed mild or moderate clinical expression.\n\n However, one-eighth of children were admitted to paediatric intensive care units and three died.\n\n","id":"PMC7408757","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Louise","surname":"Gaborieau","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Celine","surname":"Delestrain","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Philippe","surname":"Bensaid","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Audrey","surname":"Vizeneux","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Philippe","surname":"Blanc","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Aurélie","surname":"Garraffo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Emilie","surname":"Georget","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Arnaud","surname":"Chalvon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nathalie","surname":"Garrec","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yacine","surname":"Laoudi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Emmanuelle","surname":"Varon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sébastien","surname":"Rouget","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexandre","surname":"Pupin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Khaled","surname":"Abdel

shedding in pediatric patients are limited.\n\n We conducted a retrospective, multicenter study, and followed?up with all children from the families with SARS?CoV?2 infected members in Zhejiang Province, China.\n\n All infections were confirmed by testing the SARS?CoV?2 RNA with real?time reverse transcription PCR method, and epidemiological data between children and adults in the same families were compared.\n\n Effect of antiviral therapy was evaluated observationally and fecal?viral excretion times among groups with different antiviral regiments were compared with Kaplan?Meier plot.\n\n By 29 February 2020, 1298 cases from 883 families were confirmed with SARS?CoV?2 infection and 314 of which were families with children.\n\n Incidence of infection in child close contacts was significantly lower than that in adult contacts (13.2% vs 21.2%).\n\n The mean age of 43 pediatric cases was 8.2 years and mean incubation period was 9.1 days.\n\n Forty (93.0%) were family
