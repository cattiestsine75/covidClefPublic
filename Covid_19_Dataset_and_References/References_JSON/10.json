Previous research shows that for-profit LTC homes deliver inferior care across a variety of outcome and process measures, raising the question of whether for-profit homes have had worse COVID-19 outcomes than nonprofit homes.\n \nMETHODS\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of all LTC homes in Ontario, Canada, from Mar. 29 to May 20, 2020, using a COVID-19 outbreak database maintained by the Ontario Ministry of Long-Term Care. We used hierarchical logistic and count-based methods to model the associations between profit status of LTC homes (for-profit, nonprofit or municipal) and COVID-19 outbreaks in LTC homes, the extent of COVID-19 outbreaks (number of residents infected), and deaths of residents from COVID-19.\n \nRESULTS\nThe analysis included all 623 Ontario LTC homes, comprising 75 676 residents; 360 LTC homes (57.7%) were for profit, 162 (26.0%) were nonprofit, and 101 (16.2%) were municipal homes. There were 190 (30.5%) outbreaks of COVID-19 in LTC homes, involving 5218 residents and resulting in 1452 deaths, with an overall case fatality rate of 27.8%. The odds of a COVID-19 outbreak were associated with the incidence of COVID-19 in the public health unit region surrounding an LTC home (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19–3.05), the number of residents (adjusted OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.18–1.61), and older design standards of the home (adjusted OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.01–2.38), but not profit status. For-profit status was associated with both the extent of an outbreak in an LTC home (adjusted risk ratio [RR] 1.96, 95% CI 1.26–3.05) and the number of resident deaths (adjusted RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.03–3.07), compared with nonprofit homes. These associations were mediated by a higher prevalence of older design standards in for-profit LTC homes and chain ownership.\n \nINTERPRETATION\nFor-profit status is associated with the extent of an outbreak of COVID-19 in LTC homes and the number of resident deaths, but not the likelihood of outbreaks. Differences between for-profit and nonprofit homes are largely explained by older design standards and chain ownership, which should be a focus of infection control efforts and future policy.\n ","id":"S0820-3946(20)30482-X","idformat":"elsevier_pii","foundapis":"_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":" Nathan M.","surname":"Stall","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Aaron","surname":"Jones","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Kevin A.","surname":"Brown","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Paula A.","surname":"Rochon","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Andrew P.","surname":"Costa","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nathan M.","surname":"Stall","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Aaron","surname":"Jones","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kevin A.","surname":"Brown","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paula A.","surname":"Rochon","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                          Andrew P.","surname":"Costa","email":"null","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jamda.2020.06.013","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Efficacy of a Test-Retest Strategy in Residents and Health Care Personnel of a Nursing Home Facing a COVID-19 Outbreak","abstract":"Objective\nTo assess the American Testing Guidance for Nursing Homes (NHs)—updated May 19, 2020—with a new COVID-19 case.\n\n\nDesign\nCase investigation.\n\n\nSetting and Subjects\nAll 79 residents and 34 health care personnel (HCP) of an NH.\n\n\nMethods\nSeven days after identification of a COVID-19 resident, all residents and HCP underwent real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 with nasopharyngeal swabs.\n\n This was repeated weekly in all previously negative subjects until the testing identified no new cases, and in all positive subjects until the testing was negative.\n\n COVID-19 infection prevention and control (IPC) measures were implemented in all residents and HCP with positive testing or with COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n Standard IPC was also implemented in all HCP.\n\n Six weeks after initial testing, all residents underwent testing for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay–based IgG antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2.

Methods Observational study in a 185-bed nursing home with two consecutive testing strategies: testing of symptomatic cases only, and weekly facility-wide testing of staff and residents regardless of symptoms. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing with RT-PCR for SARs-CoV-2 was conducted with a standardized symptom assessment. Positive samples with a cycle threshold (CT) value below 32 were selected for sequencing. Results 185 residents and 244 staff participated. Sequencing identified one cluster. In the symptom-based test strategy period 3/39 residents were presymptomatic versus 38/74 residents in the period of weekly facility-wide testing (p-value<0.001). In total, 51/59 (91.1%) of SARS-CoV-2 positive staff was symptomatic, with no difference between both testing strategies (p-value 0.763). Loss of smell and taste, sore throat, headache or myalga was hardly reported in residents compared to staff (p-value <0.001). Median Ct-value of presymptomatic residents was 21.3, which did not differ from symptomatic (20.8) or asymptomatic (20.5) residents (p-value 0.624). Conclusions The frequency of a/presymptomatic residents compared to staff suggests that a/presymptomatic residents could be unrecognized symptomatic cases. However, symptomatic and presymptomatic/unrecognized symptomatic residents both have the same potential for viral shedding. The high prevalence symptomatic staff found in facility-wide testing suggests that staff has difficulty attributing their symptoms to possible SARS-CoV-2 infection. Weekly testing was an effective strategy for early identification of SARS-Cov-2 cases, resulting in fast isolation and mitigation of this outbreak.

occurred in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) worldwide, but the reasons why some facilities are particularly vulnerable to outbreaks are poorly understood.\n\n We aimed to identify factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreaks among staff and residents in LTCFs.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did a national cross-sectional survey of all LTCFs providing dementia care or care to adults aged 65 years or older in England between May 26 and June 19, 2020. The survey collected data from managers of eligible LTCFs on LTCF characteristics, staffing factors, the use of disease control measures, and the number of confirmed cases of infection among staff and residents in each LTCF.\n\n Survey responses were linked to individual-level SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results obtained through the national testing programme in England between April 30 and June 13, 2020. The primary outcome was the weighted period prevalence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in residents and staff reported via the survey.\n\n Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with infection in staff and residents, an outbreak (defined as at least one case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a resident or staff member), and a large outbreak (defined as LTCFs with more than a third of the total number of residents and staff combined testing positive, or with &gt;20 residents and staff combined testing positive) using data from the survey and from the linked survey–test dataset.\n\n\nFindings\n9081 eligible wLTCFs were identified, of which 5126 (56·4%) participated in the survey, providing data on 160?033 residents and 248?594 staff members.\n\n The weighted period prevalence of infection was 10·5% (95% CI 9·9–11·1) in residents and 3·8% (3·4–4·2) in staff members.\n\n 2724 (53·1%) LTCFs reported outbreaks, and 469 (9·1%) LTCFs reported large outbreaks.\n\n The odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·80 [95% CI 0·75–0·86], p&lt;0·0001) and staff (0·70 [0·65–0·77], p&lt;0·0001), and of large outbreaks (0·59 [0·38–0·93], p=0·024) were significantly lower in LTCFs that paid staff statutory sick pay compared with those that did not.\n\n Each one unit increase in the staff-to-bed ratio was associated with a reduced odds of infection in residents (0·82 [0·78–0·87], p&lt;0·0001) and staff (0·63 [0·59–0·68], p&lt;0·0001. The odds of infection in residents (1·30 [1·23–1·37], p&lt;0·0001) and staff (1·20 [1·13–1·29], p&lt;0·0001), and of outbreaks (2·56 [1·94–3·49], p&lt;0·0001) were significantly higher in LTCFs in which staff often or always cared for both infected or uninfected residents compared with those that cohorted staff with either infected or uninfected residents.\n\n Significantly increased odds of infection in residents (1·01 [1·01–1·01], p&lt;0·0001) and staff (1·00 [1·00–1·01], p=0·0005), and of outbreaks (1·08 [1·05–1·10], p&lt;0·0001) were associated with each one unit increase in the number of new admissions to the LTCF relative to baseline (March 1, 2020).\n\n The odds of infection in residents (1·19 [1·12–1·26], p&lt;0·0001) and staff (1·19 [1·10–1·29], p&lt;0·0001), and of large outbreaks (1·65 [1·07–2·54], p=0·024) were significantly higher in LTCFs that were for profit versus those that were not for profit.\n\n Frequent employment of agency nurses or carers was associated with a significantly increased odds of infection in residents (aOR 1·65 [1·56–1·74], p&lt;0·0001) and staff (1·85 [1·72–1·98], p&lt;0·0001), and of outbreaks (2·33 [1·72–3·16], p&lt;0·0001) and large outbreaks (2·42 [1·67–3·51], p&lt;0·0001) compared with no employment of agency nurses or carers.\n\n Compared with LTCFs that did not report difficulties in isolating residents, those that did had significantly higher odds of infection in residents (1·33 [1·28–1·38], p&lt;0·0001) and staff (1·48 [1·41–1·56], p&lt;0·0001), and of outbreaks (1·84 [1·48–2·30], p&lt;0·0001) and large outbreaks (1·62 [1·24–2·11], p=0·0004).\n\n\nInterpretation\nHalf of LTCFs had no cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first wave of the pandemic.\n\n Reduced transmission from staff is associated with adequate sick pay, minimal use of agency staff, an increased staff-to-bed ratio, and staff cohorting with either infected or uninfected residents.\n\n Increased transmission from residents is associated with an increased number of new admissions to the facility and poor compliance with isolation procedures.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Government Department of Health and Social Care.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7906733","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Shallcross","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Danielle","surname":"Burke","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Owen","surname":"Abbott","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alasdair","surname":"Donaldson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gemma","surname":"Hallatt","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andrew","surname":"Hayward","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Susan","surname":"Hopkins","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maria","surname":"Krutikov","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Katie","surname":"Sharp","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Leone","surname":"Wardman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                          Sapphira","surname":"Thorne","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.08.04.20165928","date":"2020-08-06","title":"Testing for SARS-CoV-2 in care home staff and residents in English care homes: A service evaluation ","abstract":"BackgroundCOVID-19 has especially affected care home residents.\n\nAimTo evaluate a nurse-led Enhanced Care Home Team (ECHT) enhanced SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy.\n\nDesign and settingService evaluation in care homes in Norfolk UK.\n\nMethodResidents and staff received nose and throat swab tests (7 April to 29 June 2020).

confirmed cases and deaths among assisted living (AL) residents and examine their associations with key AL characteristics.\n\n\nDESIGN\nObservational study employing data on confirmed COVID?19 cases and deaths in ALs from seven states, through May 29, 2020.\nSETTING\nInformation on COVID?19 cases/deaths in ALs was obtained from state government websites.\n\n A national inventory of ALs was used to identify communities with and without COVID?19 cases/deaths.\n\n Medicare Beneficiary Summary File identifying AL residents was employed to develop AL characteristics.\n\n County?level COVID?19 laboratory?confirmed cases/deaths were obtained from publicly available data.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nWe found 4,865 ALs (2,647 COVID?19 cases and 777 deaths) in the seven states.\n\n After excluding missing data, the sample consisted of 3,994 ALs (82.1%) with 2,542 cases (96.0%) and 675 deaths (86.9%).\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nOutcomes were AL?level counts of cases and deaths.\n\n Covariates were AL characteristics and county?level confirmed COVID?19 cases/deaths.\n\n Multivariable two?part models determined the associations of independent variables with the likelihood of at least one case and death in the AL, and with the count of cases (deaths).\n\n\nRESULTS\nState case fatality ranged from 3.32% in North Carolina to 9.26% in Connecticut, but for ALs in these states it was 12.89% and 31.59%, respectively.\n\n Among ALs with at least one case, midsize communities had fewer cases (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.829; P =?.\n\n004) than small ALs.\n\n ALs with higher proportions of racial/ethnic minorities had more COVID?19 cases (IRR = 1.08; P &lt;?.\n\n001), as did communities with higher proportions of residents with dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and obesity.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nALs with a higher proportion of minorities had more COVID?19 cases.\n\n Many of the previously identified individual risk factors are also present in this vulnerable population.\n\n The impact of COVID?19 on ALs is as critical as that on nursing homes, and is worth equal attention from policy makers.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7537218","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Helena","surname":"Temkin?Greener","email":"helena_temkin-greener@urmc.rochester.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wenhan","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Wenhan","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yunjiao","surname":"Mao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xueya","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

Infection rates among employees are infrequently described.\n\n\nObjective\nTo describe SARS-CoV-2 rates among SNF employees and residents during a non-outbreak time period, we measured cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 prevalence across multiple sites in the Seattle area.\n\n\nDesign\nSARS-CoV-2 testing was performed for SNF employees and residents using quantitative real-time reverse
