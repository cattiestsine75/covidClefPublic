The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 from 21 February to 20 April 2020 in the study territory was 956 COVID-19/100 000 inhabitants and the cumulative incidence of OHCA was 21 cases/100 000 inhabitants, with a 52% increase as compared with 2019 (490 OHCAs in 2020 vs.\n\n 321 in 2019).\n\n A strong and statistically significant correlation was found between the difference in cumulative incidence of OHCA between 2020 and 2019 per 100 000 inhabitants and the COVID-19 cumulative incidence per 100 000 inhabitants both for the overall territory (? 0.87, P &lt; 0.001) and for each province separately (Lodi: ? 0.98, P &lt; 0.001; Cremona: ? 0.98, P &lt; 0.001; Pavia: ? 0.87, P &lt; 0.001; Mantova: ? 0.81, P &lt; 0.001).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe increase in OHCAs in 2020 is significantly correlated to the COVID-19 pandemic and is coupled with a reduction in short-term outcome.\n\n Government and local health authorities should seriously consider our results when planning healthcare strategies to face the epidemic, especially considering the expected recurrent outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7337787","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Enrico","surname":"Baldi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

median, range and/or interquartile range","abstract":"Background\nIn systematic reviews and meta-analysis, researchers often pool the results of the sample mean and standard deviation from a set of similar clinical trials.\n\n A number of the trials, however, reported the study using the median, the minimum and maximum values, and/or the first and third quartiles.\n\n Hence, in order to combine results, one may have to estimate the sample mean and standard deviation for such trials.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this paper, we propose to improve the existing literature in several directions.\n\n First, we show that the sample standard deviation estimation in Hozo et al.\n\n’s method (BMC Med Res Methodol 5:13, 2005) has some serious limitations and is always less satisfactory in practice.\n\n Inspired by this, we propose a new estimation method by incorporating the sample size.\n\n Second, we systematically study the sample mean and standard deviation estimation problem under several other interesting settings where the interquartile range is also available for the trials.\n\n\nResults\nWe demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods through simulation studies for the three frequently encountered scenarios, respectively.\n\n For the first two scenarios, our method greatly improves existing methods and provides a nearly unbiased estimate of the true sample standard deviation for normal data and a slightly biased estimate for skewed data.\n\n For the third scenario, our method still performs very well for both normal data and skewed data.\n\n Furthermore, we compare the estimators of the sample mean and standard deviation under all three scenarios and present some suggestions on which scenario is preferred in real-world applications.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this paper, we discuss different approximation methods in the estimation of the sample mean and standard deviation and propose some new estimation methods to improve the existing literature.\n\n We conclude our work with a summary table (an Excel spread sheet including all formulas) that serves as a comprehensive guidance for performing meta-analysis in different situations.\n\n\nElectronic
