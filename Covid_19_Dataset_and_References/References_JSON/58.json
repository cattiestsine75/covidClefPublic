This study aimed to confirm whether anosmia and dysgeusia are specific symptoms among those who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n \nMETHODS\nWe conducted an age-matched case–control study in the Eastern Townships region of Quebec between Mar. 10 and Mar. 23, 2020. We included adults (age ? 18 yr) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Cases were matched (1:1) according to 5-year age groups with control patents selected randomly from among all patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 during the same period. Demographic and laboratory information was collected from medical records. Clinical symptoms and comorbidities associated with anosmia and dysgeusia were obtained by telephone interview with a standardized questionnaire.\n \nRESULTS\nAmong 2883 people tested for SARS-CoV-2, we identified 134 positive cases (70 women [52.2%] and 64 men [47.8%]; median age 57.1 [interquartile range 41.2–64.5] yr). The symptoms independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity in conditional logistic regression were anosmia or dysgeusia or both (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 62.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 11.0–359.7), presence of myalgia (adjusted OR 7.6, 95% CI 1.9–29.9), blurred vision (adjusted OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.0–0.8) and chest pain (adjusted OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.0–0.6).\n \nINTERPRETATION\nWe found a strong association between olfactory and gustatory symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. These symptoms should be considered as common and distinctive features of SARS-CoV-2 infection and should serve as an indication for testing and possible retesting of people whose first test result is negative.\n ","id":"S0820-3946(20)30401-6","idformat":"elsevier_pii","foundapis":"_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"

gustatory dysfunctions (GD) may represent the first or only symptom.\n\n This topic is currently arousing great interest, and a growing number of papers are being published.\n\n Aim of this study is to investigate the timing of recovery from OD and GD in a real-life population hospitalized for COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe followed up by a phone interview the first 100 patients discharged a month earlier from three Italian non-intensive care wards.\n\n\nResults\nAll 100 patients were Caucasian, mean age was 65 years, 60% were males.\n\n Forty-two patients (mean age 63 years) experienced subjective chemosensory dysfunctions (29 OD and 41 GD): the male/female ratio was 2:1; 83% reported a complete or near complete recovery at follow-up.\n\n The recovery rate was not significantly different between males and females.\n\n The mean duration of OD and GD was 18 and 16 days, respectively.\n\n The mean recovery time from OD or GD resulted significantly longer for females than for males (26 vs 14 days, P?=?0.009).\n\n Among the 42 symptomatic, the mean age of males was significantly higher than that of females (66 vs 57 years, P?=?0.04), while the opposite was observed in the

frequent, but longer lasting.\n\n The value of our study is its focus on a population of hospitalized patients significantly older than those previously described, and the additional data on gender

6–18 (2, 13.3); 19–50 (10, 66.7%), and 51–64 years (1, 6.7%).\n\n The patients were male (9, 60.0%) and female (6, 40.0%).\n\n Most of the patients had mild disease severity (13, 86.7%), followed by mild-moderate (1, 6.7%) and moderate-severe (1, 6.7%).\n\n The study revealed that 6 patients were asymptomatic, and 9 patients were symptomatic.\n\n The most common symptoms were: fever (n = 8; 53.3%), cough (n = 7; 46.7%), shortness of breath (n = 3; 20.0%), fatigue (n = 3; 20.0%), and taste and smell disorders (n = 4; 26.7%).\n\n All patients were recovered and discharged over a median of 8 between 8 and 21 days.\n\n The mean and Std.\n\n deviation values of the hematological were: WBC: 6.57 (1.86); neutrophil count: 3.75 (1.26); lymphocyte count: 1.87 (0.41); Hb: 13.89 (1.26); platelet count: 207.67 (52.21).\n\n\nConclusion\nAll COVID-19 cases were linked to foreign visits with few local transmissions to close contacts without community transmission.\n\n The majority of cases were mild illnesses with full recovery.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7199697","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Muayad A.","surname":"Merza","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Azad A.","surname":"Haleem Al Mezori","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Hakar Mustafa","surname":"Mohammed","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                           Deldar Morad","surname":"Abdulah","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jinf.2020.05.035","date":"2020-05-17","title":"Asymptomatic infection and atypical manifestations of COVID-19: Comparison of viral shedding duration","abstract":"\n\n\n•\nMore than 25% of patients with COVID-19 were asymptomatic.\n\n","id":"PMC7240269","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ji Yun","surname":"Noh","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Jin Gu","surname":"Yoon","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":" Hye","surname":"Seong","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":" Won Suk","surname":"Choi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Jang Wook","surname":"Sohn","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Hee Jin","surname":"Cheong","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":" Woo Joo","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"                           Joon Young","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/alr.22610","date":"2020-05-11","title":"Smell and taste alterations in COVID?19: a cross?sectional analysis of different cohorts","abstract":"Background\nOlfactory (OD) and gustatory (GD) dysfunction have been proven to be a typical symptom of severe acute respiratory syndrome?coronavirus?2 (SARS?CoV?2) infection.\n\n However, their prevalence in different patient populations still needs to be clarified.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross?sectional study was performed from March 27 to April 1, 2020, in Northern Italy.\n\n Physicians administered a survey?based questionnaire to SARS?CoV?2–positive patients with the aim of assessing symptoms, focusing on OD and GD.\n\n Two groups were studied: group A, patients hospitalized at Azianda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale (ASST) Spedali Civili University Hospital of Brescia;

Demographic characteristics, systemic and neurologic clinical manifestations, and complementary tests were analyzed.\nResultsOf 841 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (mean age 66.4 years, 56.2% men), 57.4% developed some form of neurologic symptom.\n Nonspecific symptoms such as myalgias (17.2%), headache (14.1%), and dizziness (6.1%) were present mostly in the early stages of infection.\n Anosmia (4.9%) and dysgeusia (6.2%) tended to occur early (60% as the first clinical manifestation) and were more frequent in less severe cases.\n Disorders of consciousness occurred commonly (19.6%), mostly in older patients and in severe and advanced COVID-19 stages.\n Myopathy (3.1%), dysautonomia (2.5%), cerebrovascular diseases (1.7%), seizures (0.7%), movement disorders (0.7%), encephalitis (n = 1), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (n = 1), and optic neuritis (n = 1) were also reported, but less frequent.\n Neurologic complications were the main cause of death in 4.1% of all deceased study participants.\nConclusionsNeurologic manifestations are common in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

COVID?19","abstract":"Background\nRapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome?coronavirus?2 (SARS?CoV?2) virus has left many health systems around the world overwhelmed, forcing triaging of scarce medical resources.\n\n Identifying indicators of hospital admission for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) patients early in the disease course could aid the efficient allocation of medical interventions.\n\n Self?reported olfactory impairment has recently been recognized as a hallmark of COVID?19 and may be an important predictor of clinical outcome.\n\n\nMethods\nA retrospective review of all patients presenting to a San Diego Hospital system with laboratory?confirmed positive COVID?19 infection was conducted with evaluation of olfactory and gustatory function and clinical disease course.\n\n Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were performed to identify risk factors for hospital admission and anosmia.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 169 patients tested positive for COVID?19 disease between March 3 and April 8, 2020. Olfactory and gustatory data were obtained for 128 (75.7%) of 169 subjects, of which 26 (20.1%) of 128 required hospitalization.\n\n Admission for COVID?19 was associated with intact sense of smell and taste, increased age, diabetes, and subjective and objective parameters associated with respiratory failure.\n\n On adjusted analysis, anosmia was strongly and independently associated with outpatient care (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01?0.74), whereas positive findings of pulmonary infiltrates and/or pleural effusion on chest radiograph (aOR 8.01; 95% CI, 1.12?57.49) was strongly and independently associated with admission.\n\n\nConclusion\nNormosmia is an independent predictor of admission in COVID?19 cases.\n\n Smell loss in COVID?19 may be associated with a milder clinical course.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7264572","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Carol H.","surname":"Yan","email":"c1yan@health.ucsd.edu","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":" Farhoud","surname":"Faraji","email":"NULL","contributions":"6"},{"firstname":" Farhoud","surname":"Faraji","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Divya P.","surname":"Prajapati","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":" Benjamin T.","surname":"Ostrander","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"                           Adam S.","surname":"DeConde","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s15010-020-01442-3","date":"2020-05-07","title":"Contribution of anosmia and dysgeusia for diagnostic of COVID-19 in outpatients","abstract":"","id":"PMC7221233","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_Springer_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Souheil","surname":"Zayet","email":"souhail.zayet@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Timothee","surname":"Klopfenstein","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Julien","surname":"Mercier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" N’dri Juliette","surname":"Kadiane-Oussou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Ludovic","surname":"Lan Cheong Wah","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Pierre-Yves","surname":"Royer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Lynda","surname":"Toko","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                           Vincent","surname":"Gendrin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]}]}
