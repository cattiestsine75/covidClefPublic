The state is now the epicenter of coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in the United States, with 84,735 cases reported as of April 2, 2020. We previously presented an early case series with 7 coronavirus disease 2019–positive pregnant patients, 2 of whom were diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 after an initial asymptomatic presentation.\n\n We now describe a series of 43 test-positive cases of coronavirus disease 2019 presenting to an affiliated pair of New York City hospitals for more than 2 weeks, from March 13, 2020, to March 27, 2020. A total of 14 patients (32.6%) presented without any coronavirus disease 2019–associated viral symptoms and were identified after they developed symptoms during admission or after the implementation of universal testing for all obstetric admissions on March 22. Among them, 10 patients (71.4%) developed symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 over the course of their delivery admission or early after postpartum discharge.\n\n Of the other 29 patients (67.4%) who presented with symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019, 3 women ultimately required antenatal admission for viral symptoms, and another patient re-presented with worsening respiratory status requiring oxygen supplementation 6 days postpartum after a successful labor induction.\n\n There were no confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 detected in neonates upon initial testing on the first day of life.\n\n Based on coronavirus disease 2019 disease severity characteristics by Wu and McGoogan, 37 women (86%) exhibited mild disease, 4 (9.3%) severe disease, and 2 (4.7%) critical disease; these percentages are similar to those described in nonpregnant adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (about 80% mild, 15% severe, and 5% critical disease).\n\n","id":"PMC7144599","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Noelle","surname":"Breslin","email":"nb2565@cumc.columbia.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Caitlin","surname":"Baptiste","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cynthia","surname":"Gyamfi-Bannerman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Russell","surname":"Miller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rebecca","surname":"Martinez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kyra","surname":"Bernstein","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laurence","surname":"Ring","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ruth","surname":"Landau","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stephanie","surname":"Purisch","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexander

disease 2019 in pregnancy are limited to small case series.\n\n\nObjective\nTo evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes in pregnancy and the vertical transmission potential of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.\n\n\nStudy Design\nClinical records were retrospectively reviewed for 116 pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia from 25 hospitals in China between January 20, 2020, and March 24, 2020. Evidence of vertical transmission was assessed by testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal pharyngeal swab samples.\n\n\nResults\nThe median gestational age on admission was 38+0 (interquartile range, 36+0–39+1) weeks.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (50.9%, 59/116) and cough (28.4%, 33/116); 23.3% (27/116) patients presented without symptoms.\n\n Abnormal radiologic findings were found in 96.3% (104/108) of cases.\n\n Of the 116 cases, there were 8 cases (6.9%) of severe pneumonia but no maternal deaths.\n\n One of 8 patients who presented in the first trimester and early second trimester had a missed spontaneous abortion.\n\n Of 99 patients, 21 (21.2%) who delivered had preterm birth, including 6 with preterm premature rupture of membranes.\n\n The rate of spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks’ gestation was 6.1% (6/99).\n\n One case of severe neonatal asphyxia resulted in neonatal death.\n\n Furthermore, 86 of the 100 neonates tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 had negative results; of these, paired amniotic fluid and cord blood samples from 10 neonates used to test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 had negative results.\n\n\nConclusion\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and spontaneous preterm birth.\n\n There is no evidence of vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection when the infection manifests during the third trimester of pregnancy.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7177142","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Juanjuan","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Cuifang","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Juan","surname":"Juan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xuechen","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jiafu","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ling","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chunyan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Huijun","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Qiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Di","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Guoping","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fengyi","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wencong","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qiumei","surname":"Pang","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Xiaoling","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Suqing","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dunjin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuanzhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Liona

immunoglobulin (Ig)-M and IgG for SARS-CoV-2 were negative.\n\n Maternal IgM and IgG were positive on postpartum day 4 (day 9 after symptom onset).\n\n We report a severe presentation of COVID-19
