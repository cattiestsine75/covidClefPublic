report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of US guidance using a propensity scorematched comparison.\n\n\nMethods and Results\n\nUS guidance was implemented as the default approach for all transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement cases in our institution in June 2013. We defined 3 groups of consecutive patients according to the method of puncture (fluoroscopic/US guidance) and the use of a transcatheter heart valve.\n\n Patients in the US?guided second?generation group (Sapien XT [Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA], Corevalve [Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland]) were successfully 1:1 matched with patients in the fluoroscope?guided second?generation group (n=95) with propensity score matching.\n\n In a second analysis we described the consecutive patients of the US?guided third?generation group (Evolut?R [Medtronic], Sapien 3 [Edwards Lifesciences], n=308).\n\n All vascular and bleeding complications were reduced in the US?guided second?generation group compared with the fluoroscope?guided second?generation group: VC (16.8% versus 6.3%; P=0.023); life?threatening or major bleeding (22.1% versus 6%; P=0.004); and VC related to vascular access (12.6% versus 4.2%; P=0.052).\n\n In the US?guided third?generation group the rates of major VC and life?threatening or major bleeding were 3.2% (95% CI, 1.6% to 5.9%) and 3.6% (95% CI, 1.8% to 6.3%).\n\n In the overall population (n=546), life?threatening or major bleeding was associated with a 1.7?fold increased mortality risk (P=0.02).\n\n\nConclusions\nWe demonstrated that US guidance effectively reduced VC and bleeding complications for transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement and should be considered the standard puncture method.\n\n\nRegistration\n\nURL: http://www.\n\nclinicaltrials.\n\ngov.\n\n Unique identifier: NCT02628509.\n","id":"PMC7335526","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Flavien","surname":"Vincent","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hugues","surname":"Spillemaeker","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maéva","surname":"Kyheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cassandre","surname":"Belin?Vincent","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cédric","surname":"Delhaye","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Adeline","surname":"Piérache","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tom","surname":"Denimal","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Basile","surname":"Verdier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nicolas","surname":"Debry","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mouhamed","surname":"Moussa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guillaume","surname":"Schurtz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sina","surname":"Porouchani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alessandro","surname":"Cosenza","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Francis","surname":"Juthier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thibault","surname":"Pamart","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marjorie","surname":"Richardson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Augustin","surname":"Coisne","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Adrien","surname":"Hertault","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jonathan","surname":"Sobocinski","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Modine","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"François","surname":"Pontana","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alain","surname":"Duhamel","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Julien","surname":"Labreuche","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"                            Eric","surname":"Van Belle","email":"ericvanbelle@aol.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1585","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Fisiopatologia da insufici\u00eancia card\u00edaca em pacientes com COVID-19","abstract":"Introduction: the mechanisms that are suggested as determinant in the vulnerability of patients with heart failure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and which cause the respiratory syndrome labeled COVID-19 (Coronavirus Infectious Disease-19), has revealed controversial.\n Objective: to gather information on the pathophysiological features of acute heart failure in the context of COVID-19.

impact of Wuhan-related exposure (a presumed key factor that drove the severe situation in Hubei, as Wuhan is the epicentre as well the administrative centre of Hubei province) and the duration between symptom onset and admission on prognosis were also determined.\n\n\nResults\nAt the data cut-off (31 January 2020), 1590 cases from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions were collected (core cohort).\n\n The overall rate of severe cases and mortality was 16.0% and 3.2%, respectively.\n\n Patients in Hubei (predominantly with Wuhan-related exposure, 597 (92.3%) out of 647) were older (mean age 49.7 versus 44.9?years), had more cases with comorbidity (32.9% versus 19.7%), higher symptomatic burden, abnormal radiologic manifestations and, especially, a longer waiting time between symptom onset and admission (5.7 versus 4.5?days) compared with patients outside Hubei.\n\n Patients in Hubei (severe event rate 23.0% versus 11.1%, death rate 7.3% versus 0.3%, HR (95% CI) for critical illness 1.59 (1.052.41)) have a poorer prognosis compared with patients outside Hubei after adjusting for age and comorbidity.\n\n However, among patients outside Hubei, the duration from symptom onset to hospitalisation (mean 4.4 versus 4.7?days) and prognosis (HR (95%) 0.84 (0.401.80)) were similar between patients with or without Wuhan-related exposure.\n\n In the overall population, the waiting time, but neither treated in Hubei nor Wuhan-related exposure, remained an independent prognostic factor (HR (95%) 1.05 (1.011.08)).\n\n\nConclusion\nThere were more severe cases and poorer outcomes for COVID-19 patients treated in Hubei, which might be attributed to the prolonged duration of symptom onset to hospitalisation in the epicentre.\n\n Future studies to determine the reason for delaying hospitalisation are warranted.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7144336","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wen-hua","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Wei-jie","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Cai-chen","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Yi-min","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Heng-rui","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Xiao-qing","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Ling","surname":"Sang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ru-chong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-li","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-hua","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zi-sheng","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Sook-San","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Zanin","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jian-fu","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Li-min","surname":"Ou","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Shan","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Zhan-hong","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-liang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi-xiang","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ya-hua","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-ming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ji-yang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-jian","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shao-qin","surname":"Qiu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chang-jiang","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shao-yong","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-ling","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Feng","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":"Shi-yue","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin-ping","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Nuo-fu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Nan-shan","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"

medical center in New York City and Long Island.\n\n\nParticipants\n5279 patients with laboratory confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection between 1 March 2020 and 8 April 2020. The final date of follow up was 5 May 2020.\nMain outcome measures\nOutcomes were admission to hospital, critical illness (intensive care, mechanical ventilation, discharge to hospice care, or death), and discharge to hospice care or death.\n\n Predictors included patient characteristics, medical history, vital signs, and laboratory results.\n\n Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes, and competing risk survival analysis for mortality.\n\n\nResults\nOf 11?544 people tested for SARS-Cov-2, 5566 (48.2%) were positive.\n\n After exclusions, 5279 were included.\n\n 2741 of these 5279 (51.9%) were admitted to hospital, of whom 1904 (69.5%) were discharged alive without hospice care and 665 (24.3%) were discharged to hospice care or died.\n\n Of 647 (23.6%) patients requiring mechanical ventilation, 391 (60.4%) died and 170 (26.2%) were extubated or discharged.\n\n The strongest risk for hospital admission was associated with age, with an odds ratio of &gt;2 for all age groups older than 44 years and 37.9 (95% confidence interval 26.1 to 56.0) for ages 75 years and older.\n\n Other risks were heart failure (4.4, 2.6 to 8.0), male sex (2.8, 2.4 to 3.2), chronic kidney disease (2.6, 1.9 to 3.6), and any increase in body mass index (BMI) (eg, for BMI &gt;40: 2.5, 1.8 to 3.4).\n\n The strongest risks for critical illness besides age were associated with heart failure (1.9, 1.4 to 2.5), BMI &gt;40 (1.5, 1.0 to 2.2), and male sex (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8).\n\n Admission oxygen saturation of &lt;88% (3.7, 2.8 to 4.8), troponin level &gt;1 (4.8, 2.1 to 10.9), C reactive protein level &gt;200 (5.1, 2.8 to 9.2), and D-dimer level &gt;2500 (3.9, 2.6 to 6.0) were, however, more strongly associated with critical illness than age or comorbidities.\n\n Risk of critical illness decreased significantly over the study period.\n\n Similar associations were found for mortality alone.\n\n\nConclusions\nAge and comorbidities were found to be strong predictors of hospital admission and to a lesser extent of critical illness and mortality in people with covid-19; however, impairment of oxygen on admission and markers of inflammation were most strongly associated with critical illness and mortality.\n\n Outcomes seem to be improving over time, potentially suggesting improvements in care.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7243801","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Christopher M","surname":"Petrilli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon A","surname":"Jones","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Harish","surname":"Rajagopalan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Luke","surname":"ODonnell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yelena","surname":"Chernyak","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Katie A","surname":"Tobin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert J","surname":"Cerfolio","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fritz","surname":"Francois","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                            Leora I","surname":"Horwitz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.15585/mmwr.mm6912e2","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe Outcomes Among Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)  United States, February 12March 16, 2020","abstract":"","id":"PMC7725513","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stephanie","surname":"Bialek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ellen","surname":"Boundy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Virginia","surname":"Bowen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nancy","surname":"Chow","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Amanda","surname":"Cohn","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nicole","surname":"Dowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sascha","surname":"Ellington","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ryan","surname":"Gierke","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Aron","surname":"Hall","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jessica","surname":"MacNeil","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Priti","surname":"Patel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Georgina","surname":"Peacock","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tamara","surname":"Pilishvili","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Hilda","surname":"Razzaghi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nia","surname":"Reed","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Matthew","surname":"Ritchey","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"                            Erin","surname":"Sauber-Schatz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.cmi.2020.10.017","date":"2020-10-17","title":"Clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection: a systematic review","abstract":"Objectives\nCoronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a major cause of hospital admission and represents a challenge for patient management during intensive care unit (ICU) stay.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia in critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a systematic search of peer-reviewed publications in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library up to 15th August 2020.

oxygenation (ECMO) support for COVID-19-related acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure.\n\n However, initial reports of ECMO use in patients with COVID-19 described very high mortality and there have been no large, international cohort studies of ECMO for COVID-19 reported to date.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used data from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry to characterise the epidemiology, hospital course, and outcomes of patients aged 16 years or older with confirmed COVID-19 who had ECMO support initiated between Jan 16 and May 1, 2020, at 213 hospitals in 36 countries.\n\n The primary outcome was in-hospital death in a time-to-event analysis assessed at 90 days after ECMO initiation.\n\n We applied a multivariable Cox model to examine whether patient and hospital factors were associated with in-hospital mortality.\n\n\nFindings\nData for 1035 patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO support were included in this study.\n\n Of these, 67 (6%) remained hospitalised, 311 (30%) were discharged home or to an acute rehabilitation centre, 101 (10%) were discharged to a long-term acute care centre or unspecified location, 176 (17%) were discharged to
