patients.\n\n\nMethod\nOne hundred and forty genetically unrelated Chinese SARS patients and 326 healthy volunteers were recruited.\n\n The ACE I/D genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction and agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\n\nResults\nThere is no significant difference in the genotypic distributions and the allelic frequencies of the ACE I/D polymorphism between the SARS patients and the healthy control subjects.\n\n Moreover, there is also no evidence that ACE I/D polymorphism is associated with the progression to ARDS or the requirement of intensive care in the SARS patients.\n\n In multivariate logistic analysis, age is the only factor associated with the development of ARDS while age and male sex are independent factors associated with the requirement of intensive care.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe ACE I/D polymorphism is not directly related to increased susceptibility to SARS-coronavirus infection and is not associated with poor outcomes after

polymorphism and severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong Chinese","abstract":"CD209 (DC-SIGN) is an important C-type lectin which acts a receptor of many pathogens.\n\n The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) ?336A&gt;G in the CD209 promoter has been demonstrated to regulate promoter activity and to be associated with several important infectious diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus–1 (HIV-1), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Dengue fever.\n\n CD209 facilitates severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)–coronavirus spike protein-bearing pseudotype driven infection of permissive cells in vitro.\n\n In keeping with previously published findings, our in vitro studies confirmed that this SNP modulates gene promoter activity.\n\n Genetic association analysis of this SNP with clinico-pathologic outcomes in 824 serologic confirmed SARS patients showed that the ?336AG/GG genotype SARS patients was associated with lower standardized lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH) levels compared with the ?336AA patients (p = 0.014, odds ratio = 0.40).\n\n High LDH levels are known to be an independent predictor for poor clinical outcome, probably related to tissue destruction from immune hyperactivity.\n\n Hence, SARS patients with the CD209 ?336 AA genotype carry a 60% chance of having a poorer prognosis.\n\n This association is in keeping with the role of CD209 in modulating immune response to viral infection.\n\n The relevance of these findings for other infectious diseases and inflammatory conditions would be worth investigating.\n\n","id":"PMC7115401","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kelvin Yuen

Induction of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection","abstract":"Myxovirus resistance A (MxA) is an antiviral protein induced by interferon ? and ? (IFN-?, IFN-?) that can inhibit viral replication.\n\n The minor alleles of the -88G&gt;T and -123C&gt;A MxA promoter single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with increased promoter activity and altered response to IFN-? and IFN-? treatment.\n\n Here, we demonstrate that the 123A minor allele provided stronger binding affinity to nuclear proteins extracted from IFN-?-untreated cells than did the wild-type allele, whereas the -88T allele showed preferential binding after IFN-? stimulation.\n\n Endogenous IFN-? and IFN-? induction can be suppressed in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus infection.\n\n In support of our in vitro findings, a large case-control genetic-association study for SARS coronavirus infection confirmed that the -123A minor-allele carriers were significantly associated with lower risk of SARS coronavirus infection, whereas the -88T minorallele carriers were insignificant after adjustment for confounding effects.\n\n This suggests that -123C&gt;A plays a more important role in modulating basal MxA expression, thus contributing more significantly to innate immune response against viral infections that suppress endogenous IFN-? and IFN-? induction such as SARS coronavirus.\n\n","id":"PMC7109798","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Johannes Chi-Yun","surname":"Ching","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Kelvin Yuen Kwong","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Eric Hing Leung","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Mei-Shu","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Campbell Kam Po","surname":"Ting","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Thomas M.
