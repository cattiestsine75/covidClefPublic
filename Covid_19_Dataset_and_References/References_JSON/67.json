Illinois—March–May, 2020","abstract":"Background\nPeople experiencing homelessness are at increased risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but little is known about specific risk factors for infection within homeless shelters.\n\n \nMethods\nWe performed widespread severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction testing and collected risk factor information at all homeless shelters in Chicago with at least 1 reported case of COVID-19 (n = 21).\n\n Multivariable, mixed-effects log-binomial models were built to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) for SARS-CoV-2 infection for both individual- and facility-level risk factors.\n\n \nResults\nDuring March 1 to May 1, 2020, 1717 shelter residents and staff were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 472 (27%) persons tested positive.\n\n Prevalence of infection was higher for residents (431 of 1435, 30%) than for staff (41 of 282, 15%) (prevalence ratio = 2.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.78–3.58).\n\n The majority of residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection (293 of 406 with available information about symptoms, 72%) reported no symptoms at the time of specimen collection or within the following 2 weeks.\n\n Among residents, sharing a room with a large number of people was associated with increased likelihood of infection (aPR for sharing with &gt;20 people compared with single rooms = 1.76; 95% CI, 1.11–2.80), and current smoking was associated with reduced likelihood of infection (aPR = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.60–0.85).\n\n At the facility level, a higher proportion of residents leaving and returning each day was associated with increased prevalence (aPR = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01–1.16), whereas an increase in the number of private bathrooms was associated with reduced prevalence (aPR for 1 additional private bathroom per 100 people = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87–0.98).\n\n \nConclusions\nWe identified a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in homeless shelters.\n\n Reducing the number of residents sharing dormitories might reduce the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n When community transmission is high, limiting movement of persons experiencing homelessness into and out of shelters might also be beneficial.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7665740","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Isaac","surname":"Ghinai","email":"isaac.ghinai@cityofchicago.org","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

and Europe","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global crisis.\n\n Many countries have implemented restrictions on population movement to slow the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and prevent health systems from becoming overwhelmed; some have instituted full or partial lockdowns.\n\n However, lockdowns and other extreme restrictions cannot be sustained for the long term in the hope that there will be an effective vaccine or treatment for COVID-19. Governments worldwide now face the common challenge of easing lockdowns and restrictions while balancing various health, social, and economic concerns.\n\n To facilitate cross-country learning, this Health Policy paper uses an adapted framework to examine the approaches taken by nine high-income countries and regions that have started to ease COVID-19 restrictions: five in the Asia Pacific region (ie, Hong Kong [Special Administrative Region], Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea) and four in Europe (ie, Germany, Norway, Spain, and the UK).\n\n This comparative analysis presents important lessons to be learnt from the experiences of these countries and regions.\n\n Although the future of the virus is unknown at present, countries should continue to share their experiences, shield populations who are at risk, and suppress transmission to save lives.\n\n","id":"PMC7515628","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_elsevier_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Emeline","surname":"Han","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

people living in precarious conditions in Marseille, France, March–April 2020","abstract":"Background\nSurveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among sheltered homeless and other vulnerable people might provide the information needed to prevent its spread within accommodation centres.\n\n\nMethods\nData were obtained from 698 participants in different accommodation centres (411 homeless individuals, 77 asylum-seekers, 58 other people living in precarious conditions and 152 employees working in these accommodation centres) who completed questionnaires and had nasal samples collected between 26 March and 17 April 2020. SARS-CoV-2 carriage was assessed by quantitative PCR.\n\n\nResults\nWe found a high acceptance rate (78.9%) for testing.\n\n Overall, 49 people (7.0%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, including 37 homeless individuals (of 411, 9.0%) and 12 employees (of 152, 7.9%).\n\n SARS-CoV-2 positivity correlated with symptoms, although 51% of patients who tested positive did not report respiratory symptoms or fever.\n\n Among homeless people, being young (18–34 years) (odds ratio 3.83, 95% confidence interval 1.47–10.0, p = 0.006) and being housed in one specific shelter (odds ratio 9.13, 95% confidence interval 4.09–20.37, p &lt; 0.001) were independent factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity (rates of 11.4% and 20.6%, respectively).\n\n\nDiscussion\nSymptom screening alone is insufficient to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in vulnerable sheltered people.\n\n Systematic testing should be promoted.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7872841","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_elsevier_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tran Duc

homeless shelters","abstract":"Objectives\nAsymptomatic carriers account for over a third of all Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) cases and are characterized by the absence of symptoms but the same infectivity as symptomatic infections.\n\n The high percentage of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients is significant in settings with specific vulnerabilities, such as homeless shelters, where the consequences of an outbreak may be dramatic.\n\n In this work, we briefly report our experience on residents and staff of homeless shelters in the City of Rome, Italy, with a particular focus on asymptomatic transmission, and compare it with the available evidence.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed routine Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nasopharyngeal swab tests in all residents and staff of homeless shelters managed by the Eleemosynaria Apostolica of the Vatican City State in the city of Rome, Italy, in addition to daily symptom screening, body temperature monitoring, and application of other prevention measures.\n\n\nResults\nWe evaluated 298 persons and identified twelve positive cases (4%).\n\n Most of the positive cases (75%) were asymptomatic, while only three patients reported symptoms that included fever, diarrhea, and cough.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur data confirm the importance of early identification of asymptomatic carriers that could, in vulnerable conditions such as homeless shelters, spread the infection and cause outbreaks with severe consequences on individual and public health.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7834802","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_elsevier_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Massimo","surname":"Ralli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

greater frequency of mental disorders, make this population vulnerable.\n\n\nMethod:\nWe implemented a program of serial visits in a hostel for confined homeless of the city council social services, for the monitoring and treatment of mental disorders and substance abuse problems.\n\n Accompanied by serial phone and email contacts.\n\n\nResults:\nA highly significant percentage (63%) had mental disorders or substance abuse, requiring pharmacological intervention, and 37% began follow-up in resources of the Mental Health and Addiction network of the Psychiatric Service at the end of the program.\n\n Hospital emergency service visits were drastically reduced.\n\n None of them were infected with COVID-19. An individualized Social plan was drawn up in order to reintegrate them with support in the community.\n\n\nConclusions:\nThe Results have been really positive, meeting all the objectives and opening up developing new programs in the future, in the pandemic outbreak and out of it.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7443578","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Carmen","surname":"Martin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Pilar","surname":"Andrés","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Pilar","surname":"Andrés","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Alberto","surname":"Bullón","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" José Luis","surname":"Villegas","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" José Luis","surname":"Villegas","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Javier Ignacio","surname":"de la Iglesia-Larrad","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Berta","surname":"Bote","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Nieves","surname":"Prieto","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                         Carlos","surname":"Roncero","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]}]}
