HIV-related stigma and discrimination are major barriers for overall health-related quality of life despite impressive clinical and virological improvements in HIV care. There is a scarcity of well designed intervention studies that document stigma reduction in people living with HIV and few studies that specifically assess the effect of stigma on health-related quality of life. Further, few interventions target discrimination from providers outside of HIV-specific care or involve people living with HIV in both the design and implementation. Lastly, evidence on methods to reduce stigma in several underepresented key populations and geographical regions is insufficient and research on intersectional stigma (ie, the convergence of multiple stigmatised identities) needs further attention.\n ","id":"S2352-3018(19)30343-1","idformat":"elsevier_pii","foundapis":"_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":" Galit

quantitative evidence","abstract":"Introduction\nStigma and discrimination (SAD) related to HIV compromise access and adherence to treatment and support programs among people living with HIV (PLHIV).\n\n The ambitious goal of ending the epidemic of HIV by 2030 set by the United Nations Joint Program of HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) will thus only be achieved if HIV-related stigma and discrimination are reduced.\n\n The objective of this review was to locate, appraise and describe international literature reporting on interventions that addressed HIV-related SAD in healthcare settings.\n\n\nMethods\nThe databases searched were: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), Excerpta Medica Database from Elsevier (EMBASE), PubMed and Psychological Information (PsycINFO) database.\n\n Two individuals independently appraised the quality of the papers using appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI).\n\n Data were extracted from papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI.\n\n Quality of evidence for major outcomes was assessed using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).\n\n\nResults\nWe retained 14 records reporting on eight studies.\n\n Five categories of SAD reduction (information-based, skills building, structural, contact-based and biomedical interventions) were identified.\n\n Training popular opinion leaders (POLs) resulted in significantly lower mean avoidance intent scores (MD = -1.87 [95% CI -2.05 to -1.69]), mean prejudicial attitude scores (MD = -3.77 [95% CI -5.4 to -2.09]) and significantly higher scores in mean compliance to universal precaution (MD = 1.65 [95% CI 1.41 to 1.89]) when compared to usual care (moderate quality evidence).\n\n The Summary of Findings table (SOF) is shown in Table 1.\n\n\nConclusions\nEvidence of moderate quality indicates that training popular opinion leaders is effective in reducing avoidance intent and prejudicial attitude and improving compliance to universal precaution.\n\n Very low quality evidence indicates that professionally-assisted peer group interventions, modular interactive training, participatory self-guided assessment and intervention, contact strategy combined with information giving and empowerment are effective in reducing HIV-related stigma.\n\nFurther Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are needed.\n\n Future trials need to use up-to-date and validated instruments to measure stigma and discrimination.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6347272","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Garumma

barrier to seeking appropriate treatment.\n\n More targeted interventions (e.\n\ng.\n\n at the workplace) seem to be a promising and necessary supplement to public campaigns, but little is known about their effectiveness.\n\n The aim of this systematic review is to provide an overview of the evidence on the effectiveness of interventions targeting the stigma of mental illness at the workplace.\n\n\nMethods\nSixteen studies were included after the literature review.\n\n The effectiveness of anti-stigma interventions at the workplace was assessed by examining changes in: (1) knowledge of mental disorders and their treatment and recognition of signs/symptoms of mental illness, (2) attitudes towards people with mental-health problems, and (3) supportive behavior.\n\n\nResults\nThe results indicate that anti-stigma interventions at the workplace can lead to improved employee knowledge and supportive behavior towards people with mental-health problems.\n\n The effects of interventions on employees attitudes were mixed, but generally positive.\n\n The quality of evidence varied across studies.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis highlights the need for more rigorous, higher-quality evaluations conducted with more diverse samples of the working population.\n\n Future research should explore to what extent changes in employees knowledge, attitudes, and supportive behavior lead to affected individuals seeking help earlier.\n\n Such investigations are likely to inform important stakeholders about the potential benefits of current workplace anti-stigma interventions and provide guidance for the development and implementation of effective future interventions.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

review of interventions to address self-stigma among people living with and affected by HIV","abstract":"Background\nSelf-stigma, also known as internalised stigma, is a global public health threat because it keeps people from accessing HIV and other health services.\n\n By hampering HIV testing, treatment and prevention, self-stigma can compromise the sustainability of health interventions and have serious epidemiological consequences.\n\n This review synthesised existing evidence of interventions aiming to reduce self-stigma experienced by people living with HIV and key populations affected by HIV in low-income and middle-income countries.\n\n\nMethods\nStudies were identified through bibliographic databases, grey literature sites, study registries, back referencing and contacts with researchers, and synthesised following Cochrane guidelines.\n\n\nResults\nOf 5880 potentially relevant titles, 20 studies were included in the review.\n\n Represented in these studies were 9536 people (65% women) from Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Nepal, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda and Vietnam.\n\n Seventeen of the studies recruited people living with HIV (of which five focused specifically on pregnant women).\n\n The remaining three studies focused on young men who have sex with men, female sex workers and men who inject drugs.\n\n Studies were clustered into four categories based on the socioecological level of risk or resilience that they targeted: (1) individual level only, (2) individual and relational levels, (3) individual and structural levels and (4) structural level only.\n\n Thirteen studies targeting structural risks (with or without individual components) consistently produced significant reductions in self-stigma.\n\n The remaining seven studies that did not include a component to address structural risks produced mixed effects.\n\n\nConclusion\nStructural interventions such as scale-up of antiretroviral treatment, prevention of medication stockouts, social empowerment and economic strengthening may help substantially reduce self-stigma among individuals.\n\n More research is urgently needed to understand how to reduce self-stigma among young people and key populations, as well as how to tackle intersectional self-stigma.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6441299","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Marija","surname":"Pantelic","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Janina
