Clinical and laboratory characteristics were abstracted by medical record review, and were compared with clinical characteristics of patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) (n\u2009=\u20091132), KD shock syndrome (n\u2009=\u200945), and toxic shock syndrome (n\u2009=\u200937) who had been admitted to hospitals in Europe and the US from 2002 to 2019. Exposures: Signs and symptoms and laboratory and imaging findings of children who met definitional criteria for PIMS-TS from the UK, the US, and World Health Organization.\n Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical, laboratory, and imaging characteristics of children meeting definitional criteria for PIMS-TS, and comparison with the characteristics of other pediatric inflammatory disorders.\n Results: Fifty-eight children (median age, 9 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 5.7-14]; 20 girls [34%]) were identified who met the criteria for PIMS-TS.\n Results from SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction tests were positive in 15 of 58 patients (26%) and SARS-CoV-2 IgG test results were positive in 40 of 46 (87%).\n In total, 45 of 58 patients (78%) had evidence of current or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n All children presented with fever and nonspecific symptoms, including vomiting (26\/58 [45%]), abdominal pain (31\/58 [53%]), and diarrhea (30\/58 [52%]).\n Rash was present in 30 of 58 (52%), and conjunctival injection in 26 of 58 (45%) cases.\n Laboratory evaluation was consistent with marked inflammation, for example, C-reactive protein (229 mg\/L [IQR, 156-338], assessed in 58 of 58) and ferritin (610 \u03bcg\/L [IQR, 359-1280], assessed in 53 of 58).\n Of the 58 children, 29 developed shock (with biochemical evidence of myocardial dysfunction) and required inotropic support and fluid resuscitation (including 23\/29 [79%] who received mechanical ventilation); 13 met the American Heart Association definition of KD, and 23 had fever and inflammation without features of shock or KD.\n Eight patients (14%) developed coronary artery dilatation or aneurysm.\n Comparison of PIMS-TS with KD and with KD shock syndrome showed differences in clinical and laboratory features, including older age (median age, 9 years [IQR, 5.7-14] vs 2.7 years [IQR, 1.4-4.7] and 3.8 years [IQR, 0.2-18], respectively), and greater elevation of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (median, 229 mg\/L [IQR 156-338] vs 67 mg\/L [IQR, 40-150 mg\/L] and 193 mg\/L [IQR, 83-237], respectively).\n Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series of hospitalized children who met criteria for PIMS-TS, there was a wide spectrum of presenting signs and symptoms and disease severity, ranging from fever and inflammation to myocardial injury, shock, and development of coronary artery aneurysms.\n The comparison with patients with KD and KD shock syndrome provides insights into this syndrome, and suggests this disorder differs from other pediatric inflammatory entities","id":"10.1001/jama.2020.10369","idformat":"CORE","foundapis":"_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"van","surname":"de Beek Diederik","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jpeds.2020.06.045","date":"2020-06-10","title":"Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection (MIS-C): A Multi-institutional Study from New York City","abstract":"Objective\nTo assess clinical characteristics and outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).\n\n\nStudy design\nChildren with MIS-C admitted to pediatric intensive care units in New York City between April 23 and May 23, 2020, were included.\n\n Demographic and clinical data were collected.\n\n\nResults\nOf 33 children with MIS-C, the median age was 10 years;

2-month period, contemporary with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France and Switzerland, we retrospectively collected clinical, biological, therapeutic, and early outcomes data in children who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units in 14 centers for cardiogenic shock, left ventricular dysfunction, and severe inflammatory state.\n\n\n\nResults:\nThirty-five children were identified and

148 patients (80%) received intensive care, 37 (20%) received mechanical ventilation, 90 (48%) received vasoactive support, and 4 (2%) died.\n\n Coronary-artery aneurysms (z scores ?2.5) were documented in 15 patients (8%), and Kawasakis diseaselike features were documented in 74 (40%).\n\n Most patients (171 [92%]) had elevations in at least four biomarkers indicating inflammation.\n\n The use of immunomodulating therapies was common: intravenous immune globulin was used in 144 (77%), glucocorticoids in 91 (49%), and interleukin-6 or 1RA inhibitors in 38 (20%).\n\n\nConclusions\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with SARS-CoV-2 led to serious and life-threatening illness in previously healthy children and adolescents.\n\n (Funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7346765","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Leora R.","surname":"Feldstein","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Erica B.","surname":"Rose","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Steven M.","surname":"Horwitz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jennifer P.","surname":"Collins","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Margaret M.","surname":"Newhams","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mary Beth F.","surname":"Son","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jane W.","surname":"Newburger","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lawrence C.","surname":"Kleinman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sabrina M.","surname":"Heidemann","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Amarilis A.","surname":"Martin","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Amarilis A.","surname":"Martin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Aalok R.","surname":"Singh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Keiko M.","surname":"Tarquinio","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Preeti","surname":"Jaggi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Matthew E.","surname":"Oster","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sheemon P.","surname":"Zackai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jennifer","surname":"Gillen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Adam J.","surname":"Ratner","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rowan F.","surname":"Walsh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Julie C.","surname":"Fitzgerald","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michael A.","surname":"Keenaghan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hussam","surname":"Alharash","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sule","surname":"Doymaz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Katharine N.","surname":"Clouser","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"John S.","surname":"Giuliano","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anjali","surname":"Gupta","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert M.","surname":"Parker","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Aline B.","surname":"Maddux","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vinod","surname":"Havalad","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stacy","surname":"Ramsingh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hulya","surname":"Bukulmez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tamara T.","surname":"Bradford","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lincoln S.","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mark W.","surname":"Tenforde","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christopher L.","surname":"Carroll","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Becky J.","surname":"Riggs","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shira J.","surname":"Gertz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ariel","surname":"Daube","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Amanda","surname":"Lansell","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Amanda","surname":"Lansell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alvaro","surname":"Coronado Munoz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Charlotte V.","surname":"Hobbs","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Charlotte V.","surname":"Hobbs","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kimberly L.","surname":"Marohn","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Natasha B.","surname":"Halasa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Manish M.","surname":"Patel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                            Adrienne G.","surname":"Randolph","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]}]}
