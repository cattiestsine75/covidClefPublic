treatments.\n\n Anecdotal reports suggest that plasma with high antibody titres to influenza might be of benefit in the treatment of severe influenza.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 2 trial, 29 academic medical centres in the USA assessed the safety and efficacy of anti-influenza plasma with haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres of 1:80 or more to the infecting strain.\n\n Hospitalised children and adults (including pregnant women) with severe influenza A or B (defined as the presence of hypoxia or tachypnoea) were randomly assigned to receive either two units (or paediatric equivalent) of anti-influenza plasma plus standard care, versus standard care alone, and were followed up for 28 days.\n\n The primary endpoint was time to normalisation of patients' respiratory status (respiratory rate of ?20 breaths per min for adults or age-defined thresholds of 20–38 breaths per min for children) and a room air oxygen saturation of 93% or more.\n\n This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, number NCT01052480.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Jan 13, 2011, and March 2, 2015, 113 participants were screened for eligibility and 98 were randomly assigned from 20 out of 29 participating sites.\n\n Of the participants with confirmed influenza (by PCR), 28 (67%) of 42 in the plasma plus standard care group normalised their respiratory status by day 28 compared with 24 (53%) of 45 participants on standard care alone (p=0·069).\n\n The hazard ratio (HR) comparing plasma plus standard care with standard care alone was 1·71 (95% CI 0·96–3·06).\n\n Six participants died, one (2%) from the plasma plus standard care group and five (10%) from the standard care group (HR 0·19 [95% CI 0·02–1·65], p=0·093).\n\n Participants in the plasma plus standard care group had non-significant reductions in days in hospital (median 6 days [IQR 4–16] vs 11 days [5–25], p=0·13) and days on mechanical ventilation (median 0 days [IQR 0–6] vs 3 days [0–14], p=0·14).\n\n Fewer plasma plus standard care participants had serious adverse events compared with standard care alone recipients (nine [20%] of 46 vs 20 [38%] of 52, p=0·041), the most frequent of which were acute respiratory distress syndrome (one [2%] vs two [4%] patients) and stroke (one [2%] vs two [4%] patients).\n\n\nInterpretation\nAlthough there was no significant effect of plasma treatment on the primary endpoint, the treatment seemed safe and well tolerated.\n\n A phase 3 randomised trial is now underway to further assess this intervention.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, US National Institutes of

severe influenza A: a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial ","abstract":"\nBackground\nInfection with influenza virus causes substantial morbidity and mortality globally, although antiviral treatments are available. Previous studies have suggested that anti-influenza immune plasma could be beneficial as treatment, but they were not designed as randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled trials. Therefore, we aimed to prospectively evaluate the clinical efficacy of high-titre immune plasma compared with standard low-titre plasma to improve outcomes in patients with severe influenza A infection.\n \nMethods\nWe did this randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial at 41 US medical centres to assess the efficacy of high-titre anti-influenza plasma (haemagglutination inhibition antibody titre ?1:80) compared with low-titre plasma (?1:10). Children and adults with PCR-confirmed influenza A infection, a National Early Warning score of 3 or greater, and onset of illness within 6 days before randomisation were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) using an interactive web response system to receive either two units (or paediatric equivalent) of high-titre plasma (high-titre group) or low-titre plasma (low-titre group), and were followed up for 28 days from randomisation. High-titre and low-titre plasma had the same appearance. Randomisation was stratified by severity (in intensive care unit, not in intensive care but requiring supplemental oxygen, or not in intensive care and not requiring supplemental oxygen) and age (&lt;18 years and ?18 years). All participants, site staff, and the study team were masked to treatment allocation until after the final database lock. The primary endpoint was clinical status assessed by a six-point ordinal scale on day 7 (death, in intensive care, hospitalised but requiring supplemental oxygen, hospitalised not requiring supplemental oxygen, discharged but unable to resume normal activities, and discharged with full resumption of normal activities) analysed in a proportional odds model (an odds ratio [OR] &gt;1 indicates improvement in clinical status across all categories for the high-titre vs the low-titre group). The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population, excluding two participants who did not receive plasma. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02572817.\n \nFindings\nParticipants were recruited between Jan 26, 2016, and April 19, 2018. Of 200 participants enrolled (177 adults and 23 children), 140 met the criteria for randomisation and were assigned to the high-titre group (n=92) or to the control low-titre group (n=48). One participant from each group did not receive plasma. At baseline, 60 (43%) of 138 participants were in intensive care and 55 (71%) of 78 participants who were not in intensive care required oxygen. 93% of planned plasma infusions were completed. The study was terminated in July, 2018, when independent efficacy analysis showed low conditional power to detect an effect of high-titre plasma even if full accrual (150 participants) was achieved. The proportional OR for improved clinical status on day 7 was 1·22 (95% CI 0·65–2·29, p=0·54). 47 (34%) of 138 participants experienced 88 serious adverse events: 32 (35%) with 60 events in the high-titre group and 15 (32%) with 28 events in the low-titre group. The most common serious adverse events were acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; four [4%] vs two [4%]), allergic transfusion reactions (two [2%] vs two [4%]), and respiratory distress (three [3%] vs none). 65 (47%) participants experienced 183 adverse events: 42 (46%) with 126 events in the high-titre group and 23 (49%) with 57 events in the low-titre group. The most common adverse events were anaemia (four [3%] vs two [4%]) and ARDS (four [3%] vs three [5%]). Ten patients died during the study (six [7%] in the high-titre group vs four [9%] in the low-titre group, p=0·73). The most common cause of death was worsening of acute respiratory distress syndrome (two [2%] vs two [4%] patients).\n \nInterpretation\nHigh-titre anti-influenza plasma conferred no significant benefit over non-immune plasma. Although our study did not have the precision to rule out a small, clinically relevant effect, the benefit is insufficient to justify the use of immune plasma for treating patients with severe influenza A.\n \nFunding\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA).\n ","id":"S2213-2600(19)30199-7","idformat":"elsevier_pii","foundapis":"_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":" John H","surname":"Beigel","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Evgenia","surname":"Aga","email":"null","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Marie-Carmelle","surname":"Elie-Turenne","email":"null","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Josalyn","surname":"Cho","email":"null","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Pablo","surname":"Tebas","email":"null","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Carol L","surname":"Clark","email":"null","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Jordan P","surname":"Metcalf","email":"null","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Caroline","surname":"Ozment","email":"null","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Kanakatte","surname":"Raviprakash","email":"null","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Joy","surname":"Beeler","email":"null","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" H Preston","surname":"Holley","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Stephanie","surname":"Warner","email":"null","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Carla","surname":"Chorley","email":"null","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" H Clifford","surname":"Lane","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Michael D","surname":"Hughes","email":"null","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Richard T","surname":"Davey","email":"null","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" John H","surname":"Beigel","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Evgenia","surname":"Aga","email":"null","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Marie-Carmelle","surname":"Elie-Turenne","email":"null","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Josalyn","surname":"Cho","email":"null","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Pablo","surname":"Tebas","email":"null","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Carol L","surname":"Clark","email":"null","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jordan P","surname":"Metcalf","email":"null","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Caroline","surname":"Ozment","email":"null","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Kanakatte","surname":"Raviprakash","email":"null","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Joy","surname":"Beeler","email":"null","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" H.

Multicenter Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial for Patients With Severe 2009 Influenza A(H1N1) Infection","abstract":"\nBackground\nExperience from influenza pandemics suggested that convalescent plasma treatment given within 4 to 5 days of symptom onset might be beneficial. However, robust treatment data are lacking.\n \nMethods\nThis is a multicenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Convalescent plasma from patients who recovered from the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) (A[H1N1]) infection was fractionated to hyperimmune IV immunoglobulin (H-IVIG) by CSL Biotherapies (now BioCSL). Patients with severe A(H1N1) infection on standard antiviral treatment requiring intensive care and ventilatory support were randomized to receive H-IVIG or normal IV immunoglobulin manufactured before 2009 as control. Clinical outcome and adverse effects were compared.\n \nResults\nBetween 2010 and 2011, 35 patients were randomized to receive H-IVIG (17 patients) or IV immunoglobulin (18 patients). One defaulted patient was excluded from analysis. No adverse events related to treatment were reported. Baseline demographics and viral load before treatment were similar between the two groups. Serial respiratory viral load demonstrated that H-IVIG treatment was associated with significantly lower day 5 and 7 posttreatment viral load when compared with the control (P = .04 and P = .02, respectively). The initial serum cytokine level was significantly higher in the H-IVIG group but fell to a similar level 3 days after treatment. Subgroup multivariate analysis of the 22 patients who received treatment within 5 days of symptom onset demonstrated that H-IVIG treatment was the only factor that independently reduced mortality (OR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.02-0.92; P = .04).\n \nConclusions\nTreatment of severe A(H1N1) infection with H-IVIG within 5 days of symptom onset was associated with a lower viral load and reduced mortality.\n \nTrial Registry\n\n ClinialTrials.gov; No.: NCT01617317; URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov\n\n ","id":"S0012-3692(13)60521-8","idformat":"elsevier_pii","foundapis":"_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":" Ivan F.N.","surname":"Hung","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Kelvin K.W.","surname":"To","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Cheuk-Kwong","surname":"Lee","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Kar-Lung","surname":"Lee","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Wing-Wa","surname":"Yan","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Kenny","surname":"Chan","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Wai-Ming","surname":"Chan","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Chun-Wai","surname":"Ngai","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Kin-Ip","surname":"Law","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Fu-Loi","surname":"Chow","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Raymond","surname":"Liu","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Kang-Yiu","surname":"Lai","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Candy C.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Shao-Haei","surname":"Liu","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Kwok-Hung","surname":"Chan","email":"null","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Che-Kit","surname":"Lin","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen","email":"null","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ivan F.N.","surname":"Hung","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kelvin K.W.","surname":"To","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cheuk-Kwong","surname":"Lee","email":"null","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Kar-Lung","surname":"Lee","email":"null","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Wing-Wa","surname":"Yan","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kenny","surname":"Chan","email":"null","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Wai-Ming","surname":"Chan","email":"null","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Chun-Wai","surname":"Ngai","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kin-Ip","surname":"Law","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fu-Loi","surname":"Chow","email":"null","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Raymond","surname":"Liu","email":"null","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Kang-Yiu","surname":"Lai","email":"null","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Candy C.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"null","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shao-Haei","surname":"Liu","email":"null","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Hung","surname":"Chan","email":"null","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Che-Kit","surname":"Lin","email":"null","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"                          Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen","email":"null","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41467-021-23469-2","date":"2021-03-31","title":"Effects of potent neutralizing antibodies from convalescent plasma in patients hospitalized for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection","abstract":"In a randomized clinical trial of 86 hospitalized COVID-19 patients comparing standard care to treatment with 300mL convalescent plasma containing high titers of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, no overall clinical benefit was observed.\n\n Using a comprehensive translational approach, we unravel the virological and immunological responses following treatment to disentangle which COVID-19 patients may benefit and should be the focus of future studies.\n\n Convalescent plasma is safe, does not improve survival, has no effect on the disease course, nor does plasma enhance viral clearance in the respiratory tract, influence SARS-CoV-2 antibody development or serum proinflammatory cytokines levels.\n\n Here, we show that the vast majority of patients already had potent neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at hospital admission and with comparable titers to carefully selected plasma donors.\n\n This resulted in the decision to terminate the trial prematurely.\n\n Treatment with convalescent plasma should be studied early in the disease course or at least preceding autologous humoral response development.\n\n","id":"PMC8160346","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_Springer_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Arvind","surname":"Gharbharan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Carlijn C.

A (H5N1) Virus Infection in China","abstract":"Background\nWhile human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection continue to increase globally, available clinical data on H5N1 cases are limited.\n\n We conducted a retrospective study of 26 confirmed human H5N1 cases identified through surveillance in China from October 2005 through April 2008.\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nData were collected from hospital medical records of H5N1 cases and analyzed.\n\n The median age was 29 years (range 6–62) and 58% were female.\n\n Many H5N1 cases reported fever (92%) and cough (58%) at illness onset, and had lower respiratory findings of tachypnea and dyspnea at admission.\n\n All cases progressed rapidly to bilateral pneumonia.\n\n Clinical complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 81%), cardiac failure (50%), elevated aminotransaminases (43%), and renal dysfunction (17%).\n\n Fatal cases had a lower median nadir platelet count (64.5×109 cells/L vs 93.0×109 cells/L, p?=?0.02), higher median peak lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level (1982.5 U/L vs 1230.0 U/L, p?=?0.001), higher percentage of ARDS (94% [n?=?16] vs 56% [n?=?5], p?=?0.034) and more frequent cardiac failure (71% [n?=?12] vs 11% [n?=?1], p?=?0.011) than nonfatal cases.\n\n A higher proportion of patients who received antiviral drugs survived compared to untreated (67% [8/12] vs 7% [1/14], p?=?0.003).\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nThe clinical course of Chinese H5N1 cases is characterized by fever and cough initially, with rapid progression to lower respiratory disease.\n\n Decreased platelet count, elevated LDH level, ARDS and cardiac failure were associated with fatal outcomes.\n\n Clinical management of H5N1 cases should be standardized in China to include early antiviral treatment for suspected H5N1 cases.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2515635","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hongjie","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhancheng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yuelong","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Huai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Luzhao","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibin","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhongjie","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cuiling","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Junhua","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chengping","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaoling","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xuecheng","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zigui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Longshan","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yusheng","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Huiming","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Liping","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xianfeng","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jianbao","surname":"Xin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Junqiao","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qiuyue","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhengan","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Longnv","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kunzhao","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinye","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaoning","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shichang","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lanjuan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinquan","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Erdang","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pingping","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shui

treating Ebola Virus Disease in Freetown, Sierra Leone","abstract":"Background\nConvalescent blood therapy has been a promising form of treatment for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), but less attention has been focused on it for treatment.\n\n\nMethod\nWe assessed the effectiveness of convalescent whole blood (CWB) in the treatment of consented EVD patients.\n\n We recruited 69 subjects in December 2014 up to April 2015, at the 34 Military Hospital in Wilberforce and the PTS 1 Ebola Treatment Unit in Hastings, Freetown.\n\n Forty-four were given CWB, and 25 who consented but preferred to be exempted from the CWB treatment were used to compare clinical outcomes.\n\n All were given routine treatment used at the Ebola Treatment Unit.\n\n\nResults\nOne of 44 subjects treated with CWB dropped out of the study and 31 recovered while 12 succumbed to the disease with a case fatality rate of 27.9%.\n\n For the group that was given routine treatment without CWB, 11 died with a case fatality rate of 44%.\n\n There was a significant difference between admission viral load and viral load after the first 24 h of treatment with convalescent whole blood (P &lt; 0.01).\n\n The odds ratio for survival with CWB was 2.3 (95% CI, 0.8–6.5).\n\n\nConclusion\nCWB is promising for treating EVD in resource-poor settings, especially in the early phases of outbreaks when resource-mobilization is done.\n\n Even though our sample size was small and the evaluation was not randomised, our results contribute to existing evidence that convalescent whole blood could be considered as a useful candidate for treating EVD.\n\n Further studies that are randomised will be required to further assess the efficacy of CWB as treatment option during any EVD outbreak.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112610","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"F.","surname":"Sahr","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"R.","surname":"Ansumana","email":"rashidansumana@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"T.A.","surname":"Massaquoi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"B.R.","surname":"Idriss","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"F.R.","surname":"Sesay","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"J.M.","surname":"Lamin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S.","surname":"Baker","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S.","surname":"Nicol","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"B.","surname":"Conton","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"W.","surname":"Johnson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"O.T.","surname":"Abiri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"O.","surname":"Kargbo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"P.","surname":"Kamara","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"A.","surname":"Goba","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"J.B.W.","surname":"Russell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"
