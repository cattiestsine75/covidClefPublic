Iranian COVID-19 patients","abstract":"Background\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has profoundly affected the lives of millions of people.\n\n To date, there is no approved vaccine or specific drug to prevent or treat COVID-19, while the infection is globally spreading at an alarming rate.\n\n Because the development of effective vaccines or novel drugs could take several months (if not years), repurposing existing drugs is considered a more efficient strategy that could save lives now.\n\n Statins constitute a class of lipid-lowering drugs with proven safety profiles and various known beneficial pleiotropic effects.\n\n Our previous investigations showed that statins have antiviral effects and are involved in the process of wound healing in the lung.\n\n This triggered us to evaluate if statin use reduces mortality in COVID-19 patients.\n\n\nResults\nAfter initial recruitment of 459 patients with COVID-19 (Shiraz province, Iran) and careful consideration of the exclusion criteria, a total of 150 patients, of which 75 received statins, were included in our retrospective study.\n\n Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to estimate the association between statin use and rate of death.\n\n After propensity score matching, we found that statin use appeared to be associated with a lower risk of morbidity [HR?=?0.85, 95% CI?=?(0.02, 3.93), P?=?0.762] and lower risk of death [(HR?=?0.76; 95% CI?=?(0.16, 3.72), P?=?0.735)]; however, these associations did not reach statistical significance.\n\n Furthermore, statin use reduced the chance of being subjected to mechanical ventilation [OR?=?0.96, 95% CI?=?(0.61–2.99), P?=?0.942] and patients on statins showed a more normal computed tomography (CT) scan result [OR?=?0.41, 95% CI?=?(0.07–2.33), P?=?0.312].\n\n\nConclusions\nAlthough we could not demonstrate a significant association between statin use and a reduction in mortality in patients with COVID19, we do feel that our results are promising and of clinical relevance and warrant the need for prospective randomized controlled trials and extensive retrospective studies to further evaluate and validate the potential beneficial effects of statin treatment on clinical symptoms and mortality rates associated with COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7829327","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_Springer_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Payam","surname":"Peymani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tania","surname":"Dehesh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Farnaz","surname":"Aligolighasemabadi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mohammadamin","surname":"Sadeghdoust","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Katarzyna","surname":"Kotfis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mazaher","surname":"Ahmadi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Parvaneh","surname":"Mehrbod","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pooya","surname":"Iranpour","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sanaz","surname":"Dastghaib","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ahmad","surname":"Nasimian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Amir","surname":"Ravandi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Biniam","surname":"Kidane","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Naseer","surname":"Ahmed","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pawan","surname":"Sharma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shahla","surname":"Shojaei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kamran","surname":"Bagheri

Prevention (CDC) risk factors on in-hospital mortality.\n\n The secondary objective was to assess the associated hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) bed utilization, and ICU LOS with the number of CDC risk factors.\n\n\nMethods\nA retrospective cohort study consisting of all hospitalizations with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis discharged between March 15, 2020 and April 30, 2020 was conducted.\n\n Data was obtained from 276 acute care hospitals across the United States.\n\n Cohorts were identified based upon the number of the CDC COVID-19 risk factors.\n\n Multivariable regression modeling was performed to assess outcomes and utilization.\n\n The odds ratio (OR) and incidence rate ratio (IRR) were reported.\n\n\nResults\nCompared with patients with no CDC risk factors, patients with risk factors were significantly more likely to die during the hospitalization: One risk factor (OR 2.08, 95% CI, 1.60–2.70; P &lt; 0.001), two risk factors (OR 2.63, 95% CI, 2.00–3.47; P &lt; 0.001), and three or more risk factors (OR 3.49, 95% CI, 2.53–4.80; P &lt; 0.001).\n\n The presence of CDC risk factors was associated with increased ICU utilization, longer ICU LOS, and longer hospital LOS compared to those with no risk factors.\n\n Patients with hypertension (OR 0.77, 95% CI, 0.70–0.86; P &lt; 0.001) and those administered statins were less likely to die (OR 0.54, 95% CI, 0.49–0.60; P &lt; 0.001).\n\n\nConclusions\nQuantifying the role of CDC risk factors upon admission may improve risk stratification and identification of patients who may require closer
