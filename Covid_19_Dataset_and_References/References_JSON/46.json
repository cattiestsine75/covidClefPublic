February.\n\n By 9th April 2020 Spain was the second country in confirmed cases and in deaths.\n\n On March 14, 2020, the Spanish Government declared the state of alarm to limit viral transmission.\n\n During such state, citizens must stay confined at home with few justified exceptions.\n\n This whole situation drastically changed the life of the population, which can cause a wide range of psychosocial impacts.\n\n This study explored the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the general adult population (N = 3055) during the first stages of the outbreak in Spain, as well as their anxiety, stress and depression levels.\n\n We also examined the extent to which the following variables were associated to participants’ mental health: (1) demographics; (2) degree of concern about the pandemic; (3) environmental conditions during the home confinement, (4) changes in daily life as a consequence of the pandemic; (5) contact with the COVID-19 disease; (6) actual and perceived severity of the crisis; (7) information about the COVID-19, (8) perceived health status and (9) leisure activities conducted within the last 24 h.\n\n Our results show that Spanish consider the current COVID-19 health crisis as fairly severe, and the majority felt that the COVID-19 crisis had greatly impacted on their daily life, including changes in their daily routines and cancelation of important activities.\n\n About 36% of the participants reported moderate to severe psychological impact, 25% showed mild to severe levels of anxiety, 41% reported depressive symptoms, and 41% felt stressed.\n\n Women, young, and those who that lost their job during the health crisis showed the strongest negative psychological symptoms.\n\n What worried Spaniards the most was the likelihood of suffering an economic crisis derived from the pandemic.\n\n We found factors associated with better mental health, such as being satisfied with the information received about the health crisis, conducting leisure activities, and the perception of being in good health.\n\n These findings can be used to design psychological interventions to help coping with COVID-19 pandemic, both in Spain and other countries.\n\n","id":"PMC7325630","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rocío","surname":"Rodríguez-Rey","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Helena","surname":"Garrido-Hernansaiz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

physical and psychological distress.\n\n This psychological distress was predominantly described as sleep disturbance, symptoms of anxiety and depression, post?traumatic stress, inability to make decisions and even somatic symptoms.\n\n\nDesign\nCross?sectional study.\n\n\nMethods\nFrontline nurses from designated hospitals for COVID?19 patients were invited to complete an online survey by convenience sampling, and the survey included six main sections: the General Health Questionnaire, the Perceived Social Support Scale, the Simplified Coping Style Scale, the Impact of Event

impacted Chinese college students.\n\n Several types of online mental health services were widely implemented for college students during the outbreak.\n\n This study investigated the relationship between college students’ mental health status and psychological help-seeking behavior to test the phases-decision-making model (PDM).\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted among college students in Guangdong Province using an online platform.\n\n In total, 4,164 students were assigned to the “counseling group” or “non-counseling group” according to whether they had sought psychological help because of the COVID-19 outbreak; the groups were matched based on age, sex, and grade.\n\n Demographics, perceived mental health, and experience with seeking psychological help were recorded.\n\n Fear, depression, and trauma were assessed by the COVID-19 Fear Screening Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire, and Impact of Event Scale-6.\nResults\nThe fear, depression, and trauma scores were significantly higher in the counseling group than in the non-counseling group (Ps &lt; 0.001).\n\n Fear (OR = 1.27, p &lt; 0.001), depression (OR = 1.02, p = 0.032), trauma (OR =

help.\n\n\nConclusion\nDuring the COVID-19 epidemic, the rate of psychological help-seeking was still low, and college students in poor psychological condition sought psychological counseling more.\n\n Fear, depression, trauma, experience with seeking psychological help, and perceived mental health can effectively predict psychological help-seeking behavior.\n\n These findings emphasized the importance of closely monitoring college students’ psychological status, providing psychological intervention, and improving the probability of seeking psychological

is needed to help the community.\n\n Our investigation designed to survey the general population in Saudi Arabia to assess the degree of psychological impact during the pandemic.\n\n\nMethods\nDuring the early stage of the outbreak, we conducted an online-based survey using a snowballing sample technique.\n\n The surveys collected data about several aspects of participant sociodemographic, knowledge, concerns, psychological impact, and mental health status.\n\n We assessed the psychological impact and mental health status using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n\n\nResults\nOur survey recruited 1160 respondents of the general public of Saudi Arabia.\n\n Of them, 23.6% reported moderate or severe psychological

non-pregnant women.\n\n From February 28 to March 12, 2020, a cross-sectional study of pregnant and non-pregnant women was performed in China.\n\n The online questionnaire was used to collect information of participants.\n\n The mental health status was assessed by patient health questionnaire, generalized anxiety disorder scale, insomnia severity index, somatization subscale of the symptom checklist 90, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) checklist-5. Totally, 859 respondents were enrolled, including 544 pregnant women and 315 non-pregnant women.\n\n In this study, 5.3%, 6.8%, 2.4%, 2.6%, and 0.9% of pregnant women were identified to have symptoms of depression, anxiety, physical discomfort, insomnia, and PTSD, respectively.\n\n However, the corresponding prevalence rates among non-pregnant women were 17.5%, 17.5%, 2.5%, 5.4%, 5.7%, respectively.\n\n After adjusting for other covariates, we observed that pregnancy was associated a reduced risk of symptoms of depression (OR?=?0.23; 95% CI: 0.12–0.45), anxiety (OR?=?0.26; 95% CI: 0.16–0.42), insomnia (OR?=?0.19; 95% CI: 0.06–0.58), and PTSD (OR?=?0.15; 95% CI: 0.04–0.53) during the COVID-19 epidemic.\n\n Our results indicate that during the COVID-19 epidemic in China, pregnant women have an advantage of facing mental problems caused by COVID-19, showing fewer depression, anxiety, insomnia, and PTSD symptoms than non-pregnant women.\n\n","id":"PMC7501755","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_Springer_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yongjie","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhengkui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Songxu","surname":"Peng","email":"gwxypsx@163.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Songxu","surname":"Peng","email":"gwxypsx@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruoxi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ruoxi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ling","surname":"Qi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zezhi","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiezhi","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yali","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiuli","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lingyun","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Qian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                            Xiangyang","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangxy@psych.ac.cn","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1080/15325024.2020.1761592","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Mental Health and Its Influencing Factors among Self-Isolating Ordinary Citizens during the Beginning Epidemic of COVID-19","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"10.1080/15325024.2020.1761592","idformat":"CORE","foundapis":"_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chang","surname":"J.","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Khazaie","surname":"H.","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Li","surname":"J.","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Xiaohui","surname":"Li","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Xing","surname":"Tan","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Yuanyuan","surname":"An","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                           Yuqing","surname":"Zhao","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/ijerph17072381","date":"2020-03-28","title":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health and Quality of Life among Local Residents in Liaoning Province, China: A Cross-Sectional Study","abstract":"Our study aimed to investigate the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and quality of life among local Chinese residents aged ?18 years in Liaoning Province, mainland China.\n\n An online survey was distributed through a social media platform between January and February 2020.

However, its psychological impact on patients is unclear. We aim to examine the prevalence and associated risk factors for psychological morbidities and fatigue in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection.\n\nMethodsAmidst the disease outbreak, 41 out of 105 COVID-19 patients in a local designated hospital in China were successfully assessed using a constellation of psychometric questionnaires to determine their psychological morbidities and fatigue. Several potential biopsychosocial risk factors (including pre-existing disabilities, CT severity score of pneumonia, social support, coping strategies) were assessed through multivariable logistic regression analyses to clarify their association with mental health in patients.\n\nResults43.9% of 41 patients presented with impaired general mental health, 12.2% had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, 26.8% had anxiety and/or depression symptoms, and 53.6% had fatigue. We did not find any association between pneumonia severity and psychological morbidities or fatigue in COVID-19 patients. However, high perceived stigmatization was associated with an increased risk of impaired general mental health and high perceived social support was associated with decreased risk. Besides, negative coping inclination was associated with an increased risk of PTSD symptoms; high perceived social support was associated with a decreased risk of anxiety and/or depression symptoms.\n\nConclusionsPsychological morbidities and chronic fatigue are common among COVID-19 patients. Negative coping inclination and being stigmatized are primary risk factors while perceived social support is the main protective factor.

China from February 1st to February 10th, 2020. Quota sampling was used to recruit 2993 Chinese citizens aged ?18 years old.\n\n Mental health problems were assessed with the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD) Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression inventory, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.\n\n Exposure to COVID-19 was measured with questions about residence at outbreak, personal exposure, media exposure, and impact on livelihood.\n\n General coping style was measured by the brief Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ).\n\n Respondents were also asked 12 additional questions about COVID-19 specific coping behaviors.\n\n Direct exposure to COVID-19 instead of the specific location of (temporary) residence within or outside the epicenter (Wuhan) of the pandemic seems important (standardized beta: 0.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.02–0.09).\n\n Less mental health problems were also associated with less intense exposure through the media (standardized beta: ?0.07, 95% CI: ?0.10–?0.03).\n\n Perceived negative impact of the pandemic on livelihood showed a large effect size in predicting mental

CI: ?0.34–?0.27).\n\n Our study suggests that the mental health consequences of the lockdown impact on livelihood should not be underestimated.\n\n Building on cognitive coping behaviors reappraisal

and the consequences of enforcing social distancing.\n\n This study was aimed to understand the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the psychopathological outcomes related to the first phase of this emergency.\n\n Methods: The study included 2291 respondents.\n\n An online survey collected information on socio-demographic variables, history of direct or indirect contact with COVID-19, and additional information concerning the COVID-19 emergency.\n\n Moreover, psychopathological symptoms such as anxiety, mood alterations and post-traumatic symptomatology were assessed.\n\n Results: The results revealed that respectively 31.38%, 37.19% and 27.72% of respondents reported levels of general psychopathological symptomatology, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms over the cut-off
