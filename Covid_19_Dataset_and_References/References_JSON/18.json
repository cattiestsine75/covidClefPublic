Design, Setting, and Participants: An ongoing adaptive platform trial testing multiple interventions within multiple therapeutic domains, for example, antiviral agents, corticosteroids, or immunoglobulin.\n Between March 9 and June 17, 2020, 614 adult patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled and randomized within at least 1 domain following admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory or cardiovascular organ support at 121 sites in 8 countries.\n Of these, 403 were randomized to open-label interventions within the corticosteroid domain.\n The domain was halted after results from another trial were released.\n Follow-up ended August 12, 2020. Interventions: The corticosteroid domain randomized participants to a fixed 7-day course of intravenous hydrocortisone (50 mg or 100 mg every 6 hours) (n\u2009=\u2009143), a shock-dependent course (50 mg every 6 hours when shock was clinically evident) (n\u2009=\u2009152), or no hydrocortisone (n\u2009=\u2009108).\n Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was organ support-free days (days alive and free of ICU-based respiratory or cardiovascular support) within 21 days, where patients who died were assigned -1 day.\n The primary analysis was a bayesian cumulative logistic model that included all patients enrolled with severe COVID-19, adjusting for age, sex, site, region, time, assignment to interventions within other domains, and domain and intervention eligibility.\n Superiority was defined as the posterior probability of an odds ratio greater than 1 (threshold for trial conclusion of superiority \u003E99%).\n Results: After excluding 19 participants who withdrew consent, there were 384 patients (mean age, 60 years; 29% female) randomized to the fixed-dose (n\u2009=\u2009137), shock-dependent (n\u2009=\u2009146), and no (n\u2009=\u2009101) hydrocortisone groups; 379 (99%) completed the study and were included in the analysis.\n The mean age for the 3 groups ranged between 59.5 and 60.4 years; most patients were male (range, 70.6%-71.5%); mean body mass index ranged between 29.7 and 30.9; and patients receiving mechanical ventilation ranged between 50.0% and 63.5%.\n For the fixed-dose, shock-dependent, and no hydrocortisone groups, respectively, the median organ support-free days were 0 (IQR, -1 to 15), 0 (IQR, -1 to 13), and 0 (-1 to 11) days (composed of 30%, 26%, and 33% mortality rates and 11.5, 9.5, and 6 median organ support-free days among survivors).\n The median adjusted odds ratio and bayesian probability of superiority were 1.43 (95% credible interval, 0.91-2.27) and 93% for fixed-dose hydrocortisone, respectively, and were 1.22 (95% credible interval, 0.76-1.94) and 80% for shock-dependent hydrocortisone compared with no hydrocortisone.\n Serious adverse events were reported in 4 (3%), 5 (3%), and 1 (1%) patients in the fixed-dose, shock-dependent, and no hydrocortisone groups, respectively.\n Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with severe COVID-19, treatment with a 7-day fixed-dose course of hydrocortisone or shock-dependent dosing of hydrocortisone, compared with no hydrocortisone, resulted in 93% and 80% probabilities of superiority with regard to the odds of improvement in organ support-free days within 21 days.\n However, the trial was stopped early and no treatment strategy met prespecified criteria for statistical superiority, precluding definitive conclusions.\n Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.\ngov Identifier: NCT02735707","id":"10.1001/jama.2020.17022","idformat":"CORE","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106077","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Corticosteroid therapy for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia: a beforeafter study","abstract":"Anti-inflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids may beneficially modulate the host inflammatory response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia.\n\n The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of addition of corticosteroids to the hospital protocol for treatment of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia on rates of death or intensive care unit (ICU) admission.\n\n A beforeafter study was performed to evaluate the effect of addition of corticosteroids to our institution's COVID-19 treatment protocol on hospital mortality.\n\n A total of 257 patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis were included in this study between 3 March 2020 and 14 April 2020.

inflammatory response, mainly in the lungs, triggered by SARS-CoV-2. This study aimed at evaluating at evaluating the efficacy of methylprednisolone (MP) among hospitalized patients with suspected COVID-19.\nMethods\nParallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial was performed with hospitalized patients aged ? 18 years with clinical, epidemiological and/or radiological suspected COVID-19, at a tertiary care facility in Manaus, Brazil.\n\n Patients were randomly allocated (1:1 ratio) to receive either intravenous MP (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (saline solution), twice daily, for 5 days.\n\n A modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis was conducted.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.\n\n ClinicalTrials Identifier NCT04343729.\nFindings\nFrom April 18 to June 16, 2020, 647 patients were screened, 416 randomized, and 393 analyzed as mITT, MP in 194 and placebo in 199 individuals.\n\n SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by RT-PCR in 81.3%.\n\n Mortality at day 28 was not different between groups.\n\n A subgroup analysis showed that patients over 60 years in the MP group had a lower mortality rate at day 28. Patients in the MP arm tended to need more insulin therapy, and no difference was seen in virus clearance in respiratory secretion until day 7.\nConclusion\nThe findings of this study suggest that a short course of MP in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 did not reduce mortality in the overall population.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7454320","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Christiane Maria
