Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) patients of ?18 years; 2) patients who were pregnant; 3) length of ICU stay of ?24 h; 4) insufficient medical information available.\n\n Patients' characteristics and clinical information were obtained from electronic medical and nursing records.\n\n The nutritional risk for each patient was assessed at their ICU admission using the mNUTRIC score.\n\n A score of ?5 indicated high nutritional risk.\n\n Mortality was calculated according to patients’ outcomes following 28 days of hospitalization in ICU.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 136 critically ill COVID-19 patients with a median age of 69 years (IQR: 57–77), 86 (63%) males and 50 (37%) females, were included in the study.\n\n Based on the mNUTRIC score at ICU admission, a high nutritional risk (?5 points) was observed in 61% of the critically ill COVID-19 patients, while a low nutritional risk (&lt;5 points) was observed in 39%.\n\n The mortality of ICU 28-day was significantly higher in the high nutritional risk group than in the low nutritional risk group (87% vs 49%, P ?0.001).\n\n Patients in the high nutritional risk group exhibited significantly higher incidences of acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute myocardial injury, secondary infection, shock and use of vasopressors.\n\n Additionally, use of a multivariate Cox analysis showed that patients with high nutritional risk had a higher probability of death at ICU 28-day than those with low nutritional risk (adjusted HR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.22–3.32, P = 0.006).\n\n\nConclusions\nA large proportion of critically ill COVID-19 patients had a high nutritional risk, as revealed by their mNUTRIC score.\n\n Patients with high nutritional risk at ICU admission exhibited significantly higher mortality of ICU 28-day, as well as twice the probability of death at ICU 28-day than those with low nutritional risk.\n\n Therefore, the mNUTRIC score may be an appropriate tool for nutritional risk assessment and prognosis prediction for critically ill COVID-19 patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7273137","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhigang","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yikuan","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jianmin","surname":"Ling","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shusheng","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"                            Yi","surname":"Bian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41430-020-0642-3","date":"2020-04-08","title":"Prevalence of malnutrition and analysis of related factors in elderly patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background/objectives\nTo evaluate the prevalence of malnutrition and its related factors in elderly patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.\n\n\nSubjects/methods\nIn a cross-sectional study, we evaluated the nutritional status of elderly inpatients with COVID-19 using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA).\n\n Based on MNA scores, patients were divided into non-malnutrition group (MNA???24), the group with risk of malnutrition (MNA 17–23.5) and malnutrition group (MNA score &lt;
