who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n

This study aims to investigate its epidemiologic history, and analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this

2020 were retrospectively collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimens.\n\n\nResults\nNone of the 137 patients (61 males, 76 females, aged 20–83 years, median age 57 years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.\n\n Major initial symptoms included fever (112/137, 81.8%),

Nearly 80% of the patients had normal or decreased white blood cell counts, and 72.3% (99/137) had lymphocytopenia.\n\n Lung involvement was present in all cases, with most chest computed tomography scans showing lesions in multiple lung lobes, some of which were dense; ground-glass opacity co-existed with consolidation shadows or cord-like shadows.\n\n Given the lack of effective drugs,

Hubei.\n\n Fever, cough and expectoration were the most common symptoms, 14 patients had decreased oxygen saturation, 33 had leukopenia, 53 had lymphopenia, and 82 had elevated C-reactive protein.\n\n On chest computed tomography (CT), lung segments 6 and 10 were mostly involved.\n\n A total of 287 segments presented ground glass opacity, 637 presented mixed opacity and 170 presented consolidation.\n\n Lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung with a patchy form.\n\n No significant difference was found between patients with or without Hubei exposure history.\n\n Seventeen patients had normal CT on admission of these, 12 had negative findings even10 days later.\n\n\nInterpretation\nMost patients presented with a mild infection in our study.\n\n The imaging pattern of multifocal peripheral ground glass or mixed opacity with predominance in the lower lung is highly suspicious of COVID-19 in the first week of disease onset.\n\n Nevetheless, some patients can present with a normal chest finding despite testing positive for COVID-19.

coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) infection has been widely spread.\n We aim to investigate the clinical characteristic and allergy status of patients infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\n\nMethods\n\n\n\nElectronic medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, and radiological materials of 140 hospitalized COVID\u201019 patients, with confirmed result of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 viral infection, were extracted and analyzed.\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\nAn approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7%) and female COVID\u201019 patients was found, with an overall median age of 57.0 years.\n All patients were community\u2010acquired cases.\n Fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%), fatigue (75.0%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (39.6%) were the most common clinical manifestations, whereas hypertension (30.0%) and diabetes mellitus (12.1%) were the most common comorbidities.\n Drug hypersensitivity (11.4%) and urticaria (1.4%) were self\u2010reported by several patients.\n Asthma or other allergic diseases were not reported by any of the patients.\n Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 1.4%) patients and current smokers (1.4%) were rare.\n Bilateral ground\u2010glass or patchy opacity (89.6%) was the most common sign of radiological finding.\n Lymphopenia (75.4%) and eosinopenia (52.9%) were observed in most patients.\n Blood eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe (r = .\n486, P \u003C .\n001) and nonsevere (r = .\n469, P \u003C .\n001) patients after

significantly higher proportion of Diarrhea as compared to patients within China.\n\n We also observed gender disparity among our studies, with the male population being more susceptible than the female population.\n\n Moreover, the analysis suggests that the fatality rate in China is relatively lower as compared to the fatality rate in other countries.\n\n These findings also suggest that the

International Concern (PHEIC).\n\n Clinical, laboratory, and imaging features have been partially characterized in some observational studies.\n\n No systematic reviews on COVID-19 have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess clinical, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases.\n\n Observational studies and also case reports, were included, and analyzed separately.\n\n We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate pooled prevalences and 95% confidence

systematic review and critical appraisal","abstract":"Objective\nTo review and critically appraise published and preprint reports of prediction models for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in patients with suspected infection, for prognosis of patients with covid-19, and for detecting people in the general population at increased risk of becoming infected with covid-19 or being admitted to hospital with the disease.\n\n\nDesign\nLiving systematic review and critical appraisal.\n\n\nData sources\nPubMed and Embase through Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 7 April 2020.\nStudy selection\nStudies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model.\n\n\nData extraction\nAt least two authors independently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool).\n\n\nResults\n4909 titles were screened, and 51 studies describing 66 prediction models were included.\n\n The review identified three models for predicting hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as proxy outcomes for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 47 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 (34 were based on medical imaging); and 16 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, or length of hospital stay.\n\n The most frequently reported predictors of presence of covid-19 included age, body temperature, signs and symptoms, sex, blood pressure, and creatinine.\n\n The most frequently reported predictors of severe prognosis in patients with covid-19 included age and features derived from computed tomography scans.\n\n C index estimates ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in prediction models for the general population, from 0.65 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models, and from 0.85 to 0.99 in prognostic models.\n\n All models were rated at high or unclear risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, high risk of model overfitting, and vague reporting.\n\n Most reports did not include any description of the study population or intended use of the models, and calibration of the model predictions was rarely assessed.\n\n\nConclusion\nPrediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed.\n\n This review indicates that proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic.\n\n Hence, we do not recommend any of these reported prediction models to be used in current practice.\n\n Immediate sharing of well documented individual participant data from covid-19 studies and collaboration are urgently needed to develop more rigorous prediction models, and validate promising ones.\n\n The predictors identified in included models should be considered as candidate predictors for new models.\n\n Methodological guidance should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions.\n\n Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.\n\n\nSystematic review registration\nProtocol https://osf.\n\nio/ehc47/, registration

studies, a systematic analysis of published articles with different designs and populations has yet to be conducted.\n\n The present study aimed to systematically review the risk of death associated with MERS as well as risk factors for associated complications.\n\n\nMethods\nPubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for clinical and epidemiological studies on confirmed cases of MERS.\n\n Eligible articles reported clinical outcomes, especially severe complications or death associated with MERS.\n\n Risks of admission to intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation and death were estimated.\n\n Subsequently, potential associations between MERS-associated death and age, sex, underlying medical conditions and study design were explored.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 25 eligible articles were identified.\n\n The case fatality risk ranged from 14.5 to 100%, with the pooled estimate at 39.1%.\n\n The risks of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation ranged from 44.4 to 100% and from 25.0 to 100%, with pooled estimates at 78.2 and 73.0%, respectively.\n\n These risks showed a substantial heterogeneity among the identified studies, and appeared to be the highest in case studies focusing on ICU cases.\n\n We identified older age, male sex and underlying medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus, renal disease, respiratory disease, heart disease and hypertension, as clinical predictors of death associated with MERS.\n\n In ICU case studies, the expected odds ratios (OR) of death among patients with underlying heart disease or renal disease to patients without such comorbidities were 0.6 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.1, 4.3) and 0.6 (95% CI: 0.0, 2.1), respectively, while the ORs were 3.8 (95% CI: 3.4, 4.2) and 2.4 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.9), respectively, in

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome than Women Do?","abstract":" Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been reported in 30 countries and regions, with a cumulative total of 8,099 probable cases and 774 deaths as of July 31, 2003, according to the World Health Organization.\n\n In Hong Kong, People’s Republic of China, 1,755 SARS cases and 299 deaths had occurred as of September 22, 2003. The authors analyzed data from the Department of Health, Hong Kong SAR.\n\n The data series includes details regarding sex, age, and chronic disease history.\n\n Using data from early March to September 22, 2003, the authors found that males had a significantly (p &lt; 0.0001) higher case fatality rate than females did, 21.9% versus 13.2%; the relative risk was 1.66 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.35, 2.05), and it was 1.62 (95% CI: 1.21, 2.16) after adjustment for age.\n\n Subgroup analysis was conducted by excluding health care workers (n = 386) from the analysis.\n\n The overall crude relative risk of mortality was 1.41 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.74), and the adjusted relative risk was 1.48 (95% CI: 1.10, 2.00).\n\n Thus, among SARS patients, males may be more severely affected by the disease than females are.\n\n This finding could be related to a nonuniform case definition of SARS disease, a different treatment regimen, a past smoking history, work-environment factors, or gender-specific immune-defense factors, for instance.\n\n","id":"PMC7110237","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"J.","surname":"Karlberg","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"D.
