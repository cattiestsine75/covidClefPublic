× combined volume (cm3) of the individual opacities.\n\n Eight thoracic radiologists reviewed the 40 radiographs, and a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed for the detection of lung opacities.\n\n Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors affecting opacity visibility on chest radiographs.\n\n\nResults\nThe mean QCTmass per patient was 72.4 g ± 120.8

enrolled, with 54 testing positive and 76 testing negative.\n\n The typical CT imaging features of the positive group were ground glass opacities (GGOs), the crazy-paving pattern and air bronchogram.\n\n The lesions were mostly distributed bilaterally and close to the lower lungs or the pleura.\n\n When features were combined, GGOs with bilateral pulmonary distribution and GGOs with pleural distribution were more common among the positive patients, found in 31 (57.4%) and 30 patients (55.6%), respectively.\n\n The combinations were almost all statistically significant

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nData from 103 patients who were under investigation for COVID-19 based on inclusion criteria according to the World Health Organization Interim Guidance were retrospectively collected from January 21, 2020, to February 14, 2020. All patients underwent chest CT scanning and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for COVID-19 at hospital presentation.\n\n The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) (with 95% confidence intervals) were calculated to evaluate the performance of CT.\n\n Subgroup analyses were also performed based on the geographical distribution of these cases in the province of Henan, China.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 88/103 (85%) patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR testing.\n\n The overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 93% (85%, 97%), 53% (27%, 77%), 92% (83%, 96%), and 42% (18%, 70%), respectively.\n\n Similar results were shown in both geographic regions.\n\n The respective sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for chest CT in the districts of Xinyang and Zhumadian (n = 56) were 92% (80%, 97%), 63% (26%, 90%), 93% (81%, 98%), and 56% (23%, 85%), while these indicators in the district of Anyang (n = 47) were 95% (81%, 99%), 43% (12%, 80%), 90% (76%, 97%), and 60% (17%93%).\n\n There were no significant differences in the prevalence of positive examinations in the two geographic subgroups for CT (P = .\n\n423) or RT-PCR (P = .\n\n931).\n\n\nConclusion\nAlthough initial chest CT obtained at hospital presentation showed high sensitivity in patients under

pregnant women are also affected significantly.\n\n\nObjective\nThis study aims to observe the clinical features and outcomes of pregnant women who have been confirmed with COVID-19.\nMethods\nThe research objects were 55 cases of suspected COVID-19 pregnant women who gave a birth from Jan 20th 2020 to Mar 5th 2020 in our hospital-a big birth center delivering about 30,000 babies in the last 3 years.\n\n These cases were subjected to pulmonary CT scan and routine blood test, manifested symptoms of fever, cough, chest tightness or gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n They were admitted to an isolated suite, with clinical features and newborn babies being carefully observed.\n\n Among the 55 cases, 13 patients were assigned into the confirmed COVID-19 group for being tested positive sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) via maternal throat swab test, and the other 42 patients were assigned into the control group for being ruled out COVID-19 pneumonia based on new coronavirus pneumonia prevention and control program(the 7th edition).\n\n\nResults\nThere were 2 fever patients during the prenatal period and 8 fever patients during the postpartum period in the confirmed COVID-19 group.\n\n In contrast, there were 11 prenatal fever patients and 20 postpartum fever patients in the control group (p&gt;0.05).\n\n Among 55 cases, only 2 case had cough in the confirmed group.\n\n The imaging of pulmonary CT scan showed ground- glass opacity (46.2%, 6/13), patch-like shadows(38.5%, 5/13), fiber shadow(23.1%, 3/13), pleural effusion (38.5%, 5/13)and pleural thickening(7.7%, 1/13), and there was no statistical difference between the confirmed COVID-19 group and the control group (p&gt;0.05).\n\n During the prenatal and postpartum period, there was no difference in the count of WBC, Neutrophils and Lymphocyte, the radio of Neutrophils and Lymphocyte and the level of CRP between the confirmed COVID-19 group and the control group(p&lt;0.05).\n\n 20 babies (from confirmed mother and from normal mother) were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 examination by throat swab samples in 24 h after birth and no case was tested positive.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe clinical symptoms and laboratory indicators are not obvious for asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 pregnant women.\n\n Pulmonary CT scan plus blood routine examination are more suitable for finding pregnancy women with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 infection, and can be used screening COVID-19 pregnant women in the outbreak area of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7152867","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_elsevier_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guoqiang","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yun","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection in patients in the emergency department.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nThis was a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Actcompliant, institutional review boardapproved retrospective study.\n\n From March 14 to 24, 2020, 192 patients in the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection were studied by using low-dose chest CT and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).\n\n Image analysis included the likelihood of COVID-19 infection and the semiquantitative extent of lung involvement.\n\n CT images were analyzed by two radiologists blinded to the RT-PCR results.\n\n Reproducibility was assessed using the McNemar test and intraclass correlation coefficient.\n\n Time between CT acquisition and report was measured.\n\n\nResults\nWhen compared with RT-PCR, low-dose submillisievert chest CT demonstrated excellent sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy for diagnosis of COVID-19 (86.7%, 93.6%, 91.1%, 90.3%, and 90.2%, respectively), in particular in patients with clinical symptoms for more than 48 hours (95.6%, 93.2%, 91.5%, 96.5%, and 94.4%, respectively).\n\n In patients with a positive CT result, the likelihood of disease increased from 43.2% (pretest probability) to 91.1% or 91.4% (posttest probability), while in patients with a negative CT result, the likelihood of disease decreased to 9.6% or 3.7% for all patients or those with clinical symptoms for &gt;48 hours.\n\n The prevalence of alternative diagnoses based on chest CT in patients without COVID-19 infection was 17.6%.\n\n The mean effective radiation dose was 0.56 mSv ± 0.25 (standard deviation).\n\n Median time between CT acquisition and report was 25 minutes (interquartile range: 1349 minutes).\n\n Intra- and interreader reproducibility of CT was excellent (all intraclass correlation coefficients ? 0.95) without significant bias in the Bland-Altman analysis.\n\n\nConclusion\nLow-dose submillisievert chest CT allows for rapid, accurate, and reproducible assessment of COVID-19 infection in patients in the emergency department, in particular in patients with symptoms lasting longer than 48 hours.\n\n Chest CT has the additional advantage of offering alternative diagnoses in a significant subset of patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7233439","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Anthony","surname":"Dangis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher","surname":"Gieraerts","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Christopher","surname":"Gieraerts","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yves","surname":"De
