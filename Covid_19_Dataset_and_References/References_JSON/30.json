The study questionnaire included five sections and 67 questions (scores, 0–3).\n\n The chi-squared ?2 test was used to compare the responses between professional groups, age-groups, and gender.\n\n\nResults\nStudy questionnaires were completed by 534 frontline medical staff.\n\n The responses showed that they believed they had a social and professional obligation to continue working long hours.\n\n Medical staff were anxious regarding their safety and the safety of their families and reported psychological effects from reports of mortality from COVID-19 infection.\n\n The availability of strict infection control guidelines, specialized equipment, recognition of their efforts by hospital management and the government, and reduction in reported cases of COVID-19 provided psychological benefit.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei resulted in increased stress for medical staff in adjacent Hunan province.\n\n Continued acknowledgment of the medical staff by hospital management and the government, provision of infection control guidelines, specialized equipment and facilities for the management of COVID-19 infection should be recognized as factors that may encourage medical staff to work during future epidemics.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7177038","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Haozheng","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Baoren","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Limin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Fu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yongfang","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"

study ","abstract":"\nBackground\nThe China Mental Health Survey was set up in 2012 to do a nationally representative survey with consistent methodology to investigate the prevalence of mental disorders and service use, and to analyse their social and psychological risk factors or correlates in China. This paper reports the prevalence findings.\n \nMethods\nWe did a cross-sectional epidemiological survey of the prevalence of mental disorders (mood disorders, anxiety disorders, alcohol-use and drug-use disorders, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, eating disorder, impulse-control disorder, and dementia) in a multistage clustered-area probability sample of adults from 157 nationwide representative population-based disease surveillance points in 31 provinces across China. Face-to-face interviews were done with a two-stage design by trained lay interviewers and psychiatrists with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders, the Community Screening Instrument for Dementia from the 10/66 dementia diagnostic package, and the Geriatric Mental State Examination. Data-quality control procedures included logic check by computers, sequential recording check, and phone-call check by the quality controllers, and reinterview check by the psychiatrists. Data were weighted to adjust for differential probabilities of selection and differential response as well as to post-stratify the sample to match the population distribution.\n \nFindings\n32?552 respondents completed the survey between July 22, 2013, and March 5, 2015. The weighted prevalence of any disorder (excluding dementia) was 9·3% (95% CI 5·4–13·3) during the 12 months before the interview and 16·6% (13·0–20·2) during the participants' entire lifetime before the interview. Anxiety disorders were the most common class of disorders both in the 12 months before the interview (weighted prevalence 5·0%, 4·2–5·8) and in lifetime (7·6%, 6·3–8·8). The weighted prevalence of dementia in people aged 65 years or older was 5·6% (3·5–7·6).\n \nInterpretation\nThe prevalence of most mental disorders in China in 2013 is higher than in 1982 (point prevalence 1·1% and lifetime prevalence 1·3%), 1993 (point prevalence 1·1% and lifetime prevalence 1·4%), and 2002 (12-month prevalence 7·0% and lifetime prevalence 13·2%), but lower than in 2009 (1-month prevalence 17·5%). The evidence from this survey poses serious challenges related to the high burdens of disease identified, but also offers valuable opportunities for policy makers and health-care professionals to explore and address the factors that affect mental health in China.\n \nFunding\nNational Health Commission of Health (Ministry of Health) and Ministry of Science and Technology of China.\n

infection prevention, infection control, isolation, containment and public health.\n\n However, available data on the work stress among these nurses are limited.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross?sectional survey.\n\n An online questionnaire was completed by 180 anti?epidemic nurses from Guangxi.\n\n Data collection tools, including the Chinese version of the Stress Overload Scale (SOS) and the Self?rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), were used.\n\n Descriptive single factor correlation and multiple regression analyses were used in exploring the related influencing factors.\n\n\nResults\nThe SOS

Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n\n Most respondents spent 20–24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\n\ng.\n\n, myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n\n Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.\n\ng.\n\n, treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.\n\ng.\n\n, hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05).\n\n Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.\n\n Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of

(PHQ-2).\n\n\nResults\nCompared with nonmedical health workers (n = 1,255), medical health workers (n = 927) had a higher prevalence of insomnia (38.4 vs.\n\n 30.5%, p &lt; 0.01), anxiety (13.0 vs.\n\n 8.5%, p &lt; 0.01), depression (12.2 vs.\n\n 9.5%; p&lt; 0.04), somatization (1.6 vs.\n\n 0.4%; p &lt; 0.01), and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (5.3 vs.\n\n 2.2%; p &lt; 0.01).\n\n They also had higher total scores of ISI, GAD-2, PHQ-2, and SCL-90-R obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p ? 0.01).\n\n Among medical health workers, having organic disease was an independent factor for insomnia, anxiety, depression, somatization, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p &lt; 0.05 or 0.01).\n\n Living in rural areas, being female, and being at risk of contact with COVID-19 patients were the most common risk factors for insomnia, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and depression (p &lt; 0.01 or 0.05).\n\n Among nonmedical health workers, having organic disease was a risk factor for insomnia, depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p &lt; 0.01 or 0.05).\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the COVID-19 outbreak, medical health workers had psychosocial problems and risk factors for developing them.\n\n They were in need of attention and recovery programs.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7206349","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wen-rui","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Kun","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Yin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-feng","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qing","surname":"Xue","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mao","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bao-quan","surname":"Min","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qing","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hai-xia","surname":"Leng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jia-lin","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Chang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fang-fang","surname":"Shangguan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tian-yi","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hui-qing","surname":"Dong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Han","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yu-ping","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fiammetta","surname":"Cosci","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

health and quality of life among local Chinese residents aged ?18 years in Liaoning Province, mainland China.\n\n An online survey was distributed through a social media platform between January and February 2020. Participants completed a modified validated questionnaire that assessed the Impact of Event Scale (IES), indicators of negative mental health impacts, social and family support, and mental health-related lifestyle changes.\n\n A total of 263 participants (106 males and 157 females) completed the study.\n\n The mean age of the participants was 37.7 ± 14.0 years, and 74.9% had a high level of education.\n\n The mean IES score in the participants was 13.6 ± 7.7, reflecting a mild stressful impact.\n\n Only 7.6% of participants had an IES score ?26. The majority of participants (53.3%) did not feel helpless due to the pandemic.\n\n On the other hand, 52.1% of participants felt horrified and apprehensive due to the pandemic.\n\n Additionally, the majority of participants (57.8–77.9%) received increased support from friends and family members, increased shared feeling and caring with family members and others.\n\n In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with mild stressful impact in our sample, even though the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing.\n\n These findings would need to be verified in larger population studies.\n\n","id":"PMC7177660","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yingfei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Zheng Feei","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"                          Zheng Feei","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jhin.2020.04.012","date":"2020-04-06","title":"Knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding COVID-19 among healthcare workers in Henan, China","abstract":"The study analysed healthcare workers' (HCWs) knowledge, practices, and attitudes regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\n A cross-sectional survey was conducted from February 4th to February 8th, 2020, involving a total of 1357 HCWs across 10 hospitals in Henan, China.\n\n Of those surveyed, 89% of HCWs had sufficient knowledge of COVID-19, more than 85% feared self-infection with the virus, and 89.7% followed correct practices regarding COVID-19.
