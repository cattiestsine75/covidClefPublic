COVID-19 are limited.\n\n\nObjective\nWe sought to evaluate the severity on admission, complications, treatment, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nPatients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 26, 2020, to February 5, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled and followed-up until March 3, 2020. Potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 were analyzed by a multivariable binary logistic model.\n\n Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for survival analysis in severe patients.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 269 (49.1%) of 548 patients as severe cases on admission.\n\n Older age, underlying hypertension, high cytokine levels (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-?), and high lactate dehydrogenase level were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on admission.\n\n The prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID-19 was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of Wuhan.\n\n The estimated mortality was 1.1% in nonsevere patients and 32.5% in severe cases during the average 32 days of follow-up period.\n\n Survival analysis revealed that male sex, older age, leukocytosis, high lactate dehydrogenase level, cardiac injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use were associated with death in patients with severe COVID-19.\nConclusions\nPatients with older age, hypertension, and high lactate dehydrogenase level need careful observation and early intervention to prevent the potential development of severe COVID-19.

[0.72, 1.27] ×109/L, Z?=?8.037, P?&lt;?0.001) and lymphocyte percentage (7.10 [4.45, 12.73]% vs.\n\n 23.50 [15.27, 31.25]%, Z?=?10.315, P?&lt;?0.001) on admission, and the lymphocyte percentage continued to decrease during hospitalization (7.10 [4.45, 12.73]% vs.\n\n 2.91 [1.79, 6.13]%, Z?=?5.242, P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n Alanine transaminase (22.00 [15.00, 34.00] vs.\n\n 18.70 [13.00, 30.38] U/L, Z?=?2.592, P?=?0.010), aspartate transaminase (34.00 [27.00, 47.00] vs.\n\n 22.00 [17.65, 31.75] U/L, Z?=?7.308, P?&lt;?0.001), and creatinine levels (89.00 [72.00, 133.50] vs.\n\n 65.00 [54.60, 78.75] ?mol/L, Z?=?6.478, P?&lt;?0.001) were significantly higher in the death group than those in the recovered group.\n\n C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also significantly higher in the death group on admission (109.25 [35.00, 170.28] vs.\n\n 3.22 [1.04, 21.80] mg/L, Z?=?10.206, P?&lt;?0.001) and showed no significant improvement after treatment (109.25 [35.00, 170.28] vs.\n\n 81.60 [27.23, 179.08] mg/L, Z?=?1.219, P?=?0.233).\n\n The patients in the death group had more complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (89.9% vs.\n\n 8.6%, ?2?=?148.105, P?&lt;?0.001), acute cardiac injury (59.6% vs.\n\n 0.9%, ?2?=?93.222, P?&lt;?0.001), acute kidney injury (18.3% vs.\n\n 0%, ?2?=?23.257, P?&lt;?0.001), shock (11.9% vs.\n\n 0%, ?2?=?14.618,

characteristics of advanced age, pre-existing comorbidities, dyspnea, oxygen saturation decrease, increased WBC count, decreased lymphocytes, and elevated CRP levels.\n\n More patients in the death group had complications such as ARDS, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, shock, and DIC.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7289311","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"

retrospective study","abstract":"Objective\nTo delineate the clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) who died.\n\n\nDesign\nRetrospective case series.\n\n\nSetting\nTongji Hospital in Wuhan, China.\n\n\nParticipants\nAmong a cohort of 799 patients, 113 who died and 161 who recovered with a diagnosis of covid-19 were analysed.\n\n Data were collected until 28 February 2020.\nMain outcome measures\nClinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years).\n\n Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%).\n\n Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)).\n\n Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62%), 55 (49%), and 25 (22%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%), 48 (30%), and 1 (1%)).\n\n The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days.\n\n Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50%) patients who died and 6 (4%) who recovered, and lymphopenia was present in 103 (91%) and 76 (47%) respectively.\n\n Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients.\n\n Common complications observed more frequently in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 100%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart failure (41/83; 49%), alkalosis (14/35; 40%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37%), acute kidney injury (28; 25%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20%).\n\n Patients with cardiovascular comorbidity were more likely to develop cardiac complications.\n\n Regardless of history of cardiovascular disease, acute cardiac injury and heart failure were more common in deceased patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in patients at high risk.\n\n Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, and heart failure were the most common critical complications during exacerbation of covid-19.\n","id":"PMC7190011","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"
