data for 67 SARS patients, who were grouped according to whether or not ARDS developed during the clinical course of SARS.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 32 males (mean age, 50.3 years; range, 20–75 years) and 35 females (mean age, 51.1 years; range, 23–86 years).\n\n Twenty-five patients (37.3%) were health care workers.\n\n At admission, 50 patients (74.6%) had abnormal chest radiographs, and all patients developed pulmonary infiltrates during the following week.\n\n During hospitalization, lymphopenia was found in 57 patients (85.1%); and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; n = 55; 83.3%), C-reactive protein (n = 55; 83.3%), aminotransferases (n = 44; 65.7%), and creatine kinase (n = 14; 20.9%) were also noted.\n\n ARDS developed in 33 patients (49.3%), who were generally older than the patients in whom ARDS did not develop, male, non-health care workers, and who generally had dyspnea at the time of diagnosis, and a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension or cerebrovascular accident.\n\n Patients with, versus those without, ARDS also tended to present with more severe lymphopenia and leukocytosis, and with higher levels of LDH and aspartate aminotransferase.\n\n The overall mortality rate was 31.3% (21/67), whereas the rate for patients who developed ARDS was 63.6% (21/33).\n\n Multivariate analyses showed that age greater than 65 years

239 (13.7%) critically ill patients were included.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in 164 (68.6%) patients, coagulopathy in 150 (62.7%) patients, acute cardiac

risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase;

It is caused by a new corona virus, called MERS corona virus (MERS-CoV).\n\n Most people who have MERS-CoV infection developed severe acute respiratory illness.\n\n\nAim of the work\nThis work is done to determine the clinical characteristics and the outcome of intensive care unit (ICU) admitted patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection.\n\n\nPatients and methods\nThis study included 32 laboratory confirmed MERS corona virus infected patients who were admitted into ICU.\n\n It included 20 (62.50%) males and 12 (37.50%) females.\n\n The mean age was 43.99 ± 13.03 years.\n\n Diagnosis was done by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test for corona virus on throat swab, sputum, tracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens.\n\n Clinical characteristics, co-morbidities and outcome were reported for all subjects.\n\n\nResults\nThe main symptoms among the included patients were: fever (96.87%), cough (93.75%), dyspnea (90.62%), sore throat (75%), runny nose (75%), sputum (50%), headache (43.75%), myalgia (40.62%), chest pain (37.50%), hemoptysis (37.50%), nausea and vomiting (34.37%), abdominal pain (21.87%) and diarrhea (15.62%).\n\n The presence of abdominal symptoms is significantly (P &lt; 0.05) associated with bad prognosis.\n\n Out of the included 32 patients, 18 patients (56.25%) survived and 14 patients (43.75%) expired.\n\n There was a statistically significant difference in the duration of symptoms before hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and ICU and total hospital stay between the expired group and survivors (P &lt; 0.01).\n\n Current smoking and smoking severity were statistically significantly (P &lt; 0.01) higher in the expired group compared to survivors.\n\n Also, there was a statistically (P &lt; 0.05) significant positive correlation between mortality and smoking severity (r = 0.640).\n\n Most of the expired patients presented with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates or unilateral infiltrates, but most of the survivors presented with normal radiology or increased bronchovascular markings, and this difference in the results was statistically highly significant (P &lt; 0.01).\n\n There were statistically highly significant (P &lt; 0.01) differences in the mean values of APACHE II score (21.11 ± 3.70 vs 24.21 ± 3.82), SOFA score (5.83 ± 2.64 vs 8.85 ± 2.17) and CPIS (7.55 ± 1.14 vs 8.64 ± 1.39) between the expired group and survivors respectively.\n\n Also, there was a statistically significant decrease in PH, PaO2, O2 saturation and HCO3 (P &lt; 0.05) among the expired group in comparison with the survivors, but no statistical difference regarding PaCO2 (P &gt; 0.05).\n\n There was a statistically significant positive correlation between mortality and old age (r = 0.633), obesity (r = 0.712), diabetes mellitus (r = 0.685), renal failure (r = 0.705), chronic heart diseases (0.591), COPD (r = 0.523), malignancy (r = 0.692), kidney transplantation (r = 0.644) and liver cirrhosis (r = 0.525) (P &lt; 0.05).\n\n There was a statistically (P &lt; 0.05) positive correlation between the number of associated co-morbidities and mortality (r = 0.735).\n\n\nConclusions\nMost MERS corona patients present with fever, cough, dyspnea, sore throat, runny nose and sputum.\n\n The presence of abdominal symptoms may indicate bad prognosis.\n\n Prolonged duration of symptoms before patients’ hospitalization, prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay, bilateral radiological pulmonary infiltrates, and hypoxemic respiratory failure were found to be strong predictors of mortality in such patients.\n\n Also, old age, current smoking, smoking severity, presence of associated co-morbidities like obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic heart diseases, COPD, malignancy, renal failure, renal transplantation and liver cirrhosis are associated with a poor outcome of ICU admitted MERS corona virus infected patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7132710","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ashraf

understood disease with no known treatments.\n\n We describe the clinical features and treatment outcomes of patients with laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV at a regional referral center in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn 2014, a retrospective chart review was performed on patients with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of MERS-CoV to determine clinical and treatment characteristics associated with death.\n\n Confounding was evaluated and a multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the independent effect of treatments administered.\n\n\nResults\nFifty-one patients

another person with MERS-CoV.\n\n Survival was associated with male gender, working as a healthcare worker, history of hypertension, vomiting on admission, elevated respiratory rate, abnormal lung exam, elevated alanine transaminase (ALT), clearance of MERS-CoV on repeat PCR polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, and mycophenolate mofetil treatment.\n\n Survival was reduced in the presence of
