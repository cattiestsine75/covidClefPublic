SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak in Northern Italy","abstract":"Background:\nFrom February 20 to April 2020, the coronavirus SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-CoV-2 spread in northern Italy, drastically challenging the care capacities of the national health care system.\n\n Unprepared for this emergency, hospitals have quickly reformulated paths of assistance in an effort to guarantee treatment for infected patients.\n\n Orthopaedic departments have been focused on elderly traumatology, especially the treatment of femoral neck fractures in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).\n\n The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the orthopaedic management strategy for femoral fragility fractures in COVID-19-positive patients with the hypothesis that operative treatment may contribute to the overall stability of the patient.\n\n\nMethods:\nSixteen patients affected by proximal femoral fracture and a recent history of fever, shortness of breath, and desaturation were admitted to the emergency room.\n\n Thoracic computed tomography (CT) and oropharyngeal swabs confirmed that they were positive for COVID-19, requiring hospitalization and prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin.\n\n\nResults:\nThree patients died before surgery because of severe respiratory insufficiency and multiple-organ-failure syndrome.\n\n Ten patients underwent surgery on the day after admission, whereas 3 patients had suspended their use of direct thrombin inhibitors and needed surgery to be delayed until the third day after admission.\n\n In all patients except 1, we noted an improvement in terms of O2 saturation and assisted respiration.\n\n In 9 patients, hemodynamic and respiratory stability was observed at an average of 7 days postoperatively.\n\n Four patients who underwent surgical treatment died of respiratory failure on the first day after surgery (1 patient), the third day after surgery (2 patients), or the seventh day after surgery (1 patient).\n\n\nConclusions:\nWe noted a stabilization of respiratory parameters in 12 COVID-19-positive patients who underwent surgery treatment of proximal femoral fractures.\n\n We believe that in elderly patients with COVID-19 who have proximal femoral fractures, surgery may contribute to the overall stability of the patient, seated mobilization, improvement in physiological ventilation, and general patient comfort in bed.\n\n\nLevel of Evidence:\nPrognostic Level IV.\n\n See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7224593","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Francesco","surname":"Catellani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

in parturients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and their newborns, and to evaluate the standardized procedures for protecting medical staff.\n\n\nMethods\nWe retrospectively reviewed the cases of parturients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection disease (COVID-19).\n\n Their epidemiologic history, chest computed tomography scans, laboratory measurements, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positivity were evaluated.\n\n We also recorded the patients’ demographic and clinical characteristics, anesthesia and surgery-related data, maternal and neonatal complications, as well as the health status of the involved medical staff.\n\n\nResults\nThe clinical characteristics of 17 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those previously reported in non-pregnant adult patients.\n\n All of the 17 patients underwent Cesarean delivery with anesthesia performed according to standardized anesthesia/surgery procedures.\n\n Fourteen of the patients underwent continuous epidural anesthesia with 12 experiencing significant intraoperative hypotension.\n\n Three patients received general anesthesia with tracheal intubation because emergency surgery was needed.\n\n Three of the parturients are still recovering from their Cesarean delivery and are receiving in-hospital treatment for COVID-19. Three neonates were born prematurely.\n\n There were no deaths or serious neonatal asphyxia events.\n\n All neonatal SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were negative.\n\n No medical staff were infected throughout the patient care period.\n\n\nConclusions\nBoth epidural and general anesthesia were safely used for Cesarean delivery in the parturients with COVID-19. Nevertheless, the incidence of hypotension during epidural anesthesia appeared excessive.\n\n Proper patient transfer, medical staff access procedures, and effective biosafety precautions are important to protect medical staff from COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7090434","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_Springer_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yuan","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Lei","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Bi-heng","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Zhong-yuan","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                           Qing-tao","surname":"Meng","email":"mengqingtao2018@126.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.4621","date":"2023-05-27","title":"'Possible Vertical Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 From an Infected Mother to Her Newborn'","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"10.1001/jama.2020.4621","idformat":"CROSSREF","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"PUBLISHER: American Medical Association (AMA)","authors":[{"firstname":"Lan","surname":"Dong","email":"xref no email","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":" Jinhua","surname":"Tian","email":"xref no email","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":" Songming","surname":"He","email":"xref no email","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":" Chuchao","surname":"Zhu","email":"xref no email","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":" Jian","surname":"Wang","email":"xref no email","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Chen","surname":"Liu","email":"xref no email","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"       Jing","surname":"Yang","email":"xref no email","contributions":"3"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00540-020-02796-6","date":"2020-05-09","title":"Anesthesia and protection in an emergency cesarean section for pregnant woman infected with a novel coronavirus: case report and literature review","abstract":"An outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia occurred worldwide since December 2019, which had been named COVID-19 subsequently.\n\n It is extremely transmissive that infection in pregnant women were unavoidable.\n\n The delivery process will produce large amount of contaminated media, leaving a challenge for medical personnel to ensure both the safety of the mother and infant and good self-protection.\n\n Only rare cases of pregnant women with COVID-19 are available for reference.\n\n Here, we report a 30-year-old woman had reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 at 36 weeks 2 days of gestation.\n\n Significant low and high variability of fetal heart rate baseline and severe variable decelerations were repeated after admission.\n\n An emergency cesarean section at 37 weeks 1 day of gestation under combined spinal and epidural anesthesia was performed with strict protection for all personnel.\n\n Anesthesia and operation went uneventfully.\n\n None of the participants were infected.\n\n We can conclude that when confronted with cesarean section in parturient with COVID-19, careful planning and detailed preparation can improve the safety of the mother and infant and reduce the risk of infection for medical staff to help preventing and controlling the epidemic.\n\n","id":"PMC7235437","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_Springer_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yin","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Long","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Gang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Xiaoming","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Wei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"                           Jianrui","surname":"Lv","email":"lvjianrui@163.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/1471-0528.16278","date":"2020-04-23","title":"Vaginal delivery in SARS?CoV?2?infected pregnant women in Northern Italy: a retrospective analysis","abstract":"Objective\nTo report mode of delivery and immediate neonatal outcome in women infected with COVID?19.\nDesign\nRetrospective study.\n\n\nSetting\nTwelve hospitals in northern Italy.\n\n\nParticipants\nPregnant women with COVID?19?confirmed infection who delivered.\n\n\nExposure\nCOVID 19 infection in pregnancy.\n\n\nMethods\nSARS?CoV?2?infected women who were admitted and delivered from 1 to 20 March 2020 were eligible.\n\n Data were collected from the clinical records using a standardised questionnaire on maternal general characteristics, any medical or obstetric co?morbidity, course of pregnancy, clinical signs and symptoms, treatment of COVID 19 infection, mode of delivery, neonatal data and breastfeeding.\n\n\nMain outcome and measures\nData on mode of delivery and neonatal outcome.\n\n\nResults\nIn all, 42 women with COVID?19 delivered at the participating centres;

SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed preoperatively in 294 (26·1%) patients.\n\n 30-day mortality was 23·8% (268 of 1128).\n\n Pulmonary complications occurred in 577 (51·2%) of 1128 patients; 30-day mortality in these patients was 38·0% (219 of 577), accounting for 81·7% (219 of 268) of all deaths.\n\n In adjusted analyses, 30-day mortality was associated with male sex (odds ratio 1·75 [95% CI 1·28–2·40], p&lt;0·0001), age 70 years or older versus younger than 70 years (2·30 [1·65–3·22], p&lt;0·0001), American Society of Anesthesiologists grades 3–5 versus grades 1–2 (2·35 [1·57–3·53], p&lt;0·0001), malignant versus benign or obstetric diagnosis (1·55 [1·01–2·39], p=0·046), emergency versus elective surgery (1·67 [1·06–2·63], p=0·026), and major versus minor surgery (1·52 [1·01–2·31], p=0·047).\n\n\nInterpretation\nPostoperative pulmonary complications occur in half of patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection and are associated with high mortality.\n\n Thresholds for surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic should be higher than during normal practice, particularly in men aged 70 years and older.\n\n Consideration should be given for postponing non-urgent procedures and promoting non-operative treatment to delay or avoid the need for surgery.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Association of Coloproctology of Great

2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by following anesthesia management protocols, and to document clinical- and anesthesia-related characteristics of these patients.\n\n\nDesign\nThis was a retrospective, multicenter clinical study.\n\n\nSetting\nThis study used a multicenter dataset from 4 hospitals in Wuhan, China.\n\n\nParticipants\nPatients and health care providers with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV from January 23 to 31, 2020, at the Wuhan Union Hospital, the Wuhan Children's Hospital, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, and the Wuhan Fourth Hospital in Wuhan, China.\n\n\nInterventions\nAnesthetic management and infection control guidelines for emergency procedures for patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were drafted and applied in 4 hospitals in Wuhan.\n\n\nMeasurements and Main Results\nCross-infection in the operating rooms of the 4 hospitals was effectively reduced by implementing the new measures and procedures.\n\n The majority of patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection or suspected infection were female (23 [62%] of 37), and the mean age was 41.0 years old (standard deviation 19.6; range 4-78).\n\n 10 (27%) patients had chronic medical illnesses, including 4 (11%) with diabetes, 8 (22%) with hypertension, and 8 (22%) with digestive system disease.\n\n Twenty-five (68%) patients presented with lymphopenia, and 23 (62%) patients exhibited multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity on computed tomography scanning.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe present study indicates that COVID 19–specific guidelines for emergency procedures for patients with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV may effectively prevent cross-infection in the operating room.\n\n Most patients with confirmed or suspected COVID 19 presented with fever and dry cough and demonstrated bilateral multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity on chest computed tomography
