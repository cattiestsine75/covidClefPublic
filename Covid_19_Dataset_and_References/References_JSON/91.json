and Behavioral Impact of COVID-19 in Autism Spectrum Disorder: An Online Parent Survey","abstract":"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak could result in higher levels of psychological distress, especially among people suffering from pre-existing mental health conditions.\n\n Young individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are particularly at risk due to their vulnerability to unpredictable and complex changes.\n\n This study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ASD individuals, whether any pre-pandemic sociodemographic or clinical characteristics would predict a negative outcome, and to narratively characterize their needs.\n\n Parents and guardians of ASD individuals filled out an online survey consisting of 40 questions investigating socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of their children, impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on their wellbeing and needs to deal with the emergency.\n\n Data were available on 527 survey participants.\n\n The COVID-19 emergency resulted in a challenging period for 93.9% of families, increased difficulties in managing daily activities, especially free time (78.1%) and structured activities (75.7%), and, respectively, 35.5% and 41.5% of children presenting with more intense and more frequent behavior problems.\n\n Behavior problems predating the COVID-19 outbreak predicted a higher risk of more intense (odds ratio (OR) = 2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42–3.29) and more frequent (OR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.13–2.48) disruptive behavior.\n\n Even though ASD children were receiving different types of support, also requiring specialist (19.1%) or emergency (1.5%) interventions in a relatively low proportion of cases, a number of needs emerged, including receiving more healthcare support (47.4%), especially in-home support (29.9%), as well as interventions to tackle a potentially disruptive quarantine (16.8%).\n\n The COVID-19 outbreak has undoubtedly resulted in increased difficulties among ASD individuals.\n\n

during the COVID-19 epidemic in China","abstract":"Background\nA cluster of pneumonia cases were reported by Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, China in December 2019. A novel coronavirus was eventually identified, and became the COVID-19 epidemic that affected public health and life.\n\n We investigated the psychological status and behavior changes of the general public in China from January 30 to February 3, 2020.\nMethods\nRespondents were recruited via social media (WeChat) and completed an online questionnaire.\n\n We used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Self-rating Depression Scale, and Symptom Checklist-90 to evaluate psychological status.\n\n We also investigated respondents’ behavior changes.\n\n Quantitative data were analyzed by t-tests or analysis of variance, and classified data were analyzed with chi-square tests.\n\n\nResults\nIn total, 608 valid questionnaires were obtained.\n\n More respondents had state anxiety than trait anxiety (15.8% vs 4.0%).\n\n Depression was found among 27.1% of respondents and 7.7% had psychological abnormalities.\n\n About 10.1% of respondents suffered from phobia.\n\n Our analysis of the relationship between subgroup characteristics and psychological status showed that age, gender, knowledge about COVID-19, degree of worry about epidemiological infection, and confidence about overcoming the outbreak significantly influenced psychological status.\n\n Around 93.3% of respondents avoided going to public places and almost all respondents reduced Spring Festival-related activities.\n\n At least 70.9% of respondents chose to take three or more preventive measures to avoid infection.\n\n The three most commonly used prevention measures were making fewer trips outside and avoiding contact (98.0%), wearing a mask (83.7%), and hand hygiene (82.4%).\n\n\nConclusions\nWe need to pay more attention to public psychological stress, especially among young people, as they are likely to experience anxiety, depression, and psychological abnormalities.\n\n Different psychological interventions could be formulated according to the psychological characteristics of different gender and age groups.\n\n The majority of respondents followed specific behaviors required by the authorities, but it will take time to observe the effects of these behaviors on the epidemic.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7256340","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_Springer_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Associations With Mental and Social Health","abstract":"Purpose\nReducing the spread of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic prompted recommendations for individuals to socially distance.\n\n Little is known about the extent to which youth are socially distancing, what motivations underlie their social distancing, and how these motivations are connected with amount of social distancing, mental health, and social health.\n\n Using a large sample of adolescents from across the United States, this study examined adolescents' motivations for social distancing, their engagement in social distancing, and their mental and social health.\n\n\nMethods\nData were collected on March 29th and 30th, 2020, two weeks after COVID-19 was declared a national emergency in the United States.\n\n The sample consisted of 683 adolescents recruited using social media.\n\n A series of multiple linear regressions examined unique associations among adolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing, perceived amount of social distancing, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness.\n\n\nResults\nAlmost all respondents (98.1%) reported engaging in at least a little social distancing.\n\n The most commonly reported motivations for social distancing concerned social responsibility and not wanting others to get sick.\n\n Motivations concerning state or city lockdowns, parental rules, and social responsibility were associated with greater social distancing, whereas motivations concerning no alternatives were associated with less social distancing.\n\n Specific motivations for social distancing were differentially associated with adolescents' anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness.\n\n\nConclusions\nUnderstanding adolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing may inform strategies to increase social distancing engagement, reduce pathogen transmission, and identify individual differences in mental and social health during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7205689","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Benjamin","surname":"Oosterhoff","email":"Benjamin.oosterhoff@montana.edu","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"
