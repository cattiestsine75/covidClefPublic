severity of the disease.\n Methods: 29 patients with 2019-ncov admitted to the isolation ward of Tongji hospital affiliated to Tongji medical college of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in January 2020 were selected as the study subjects.\n Clinical data were collected and the general information, clinical symptoms, blood test and CT imaging characteristics were analyzed.\n According to the relevant diagnostic criteria, the patients were divided into three groups: mild (15 cases), severe (9 cases) and critical (5 cases).\n The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and other markers in the serum of each group were detected, and the changes of these indicators of the three groups were compared and analyzed, as well as their relationship with the clinical classification of the disease.\n Results: (1) The main symptoms of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was fever (28/29) with or without respiratory and other systemic symptoms.\n Two patients died with underlying disease and co-bacterial infection, respectively.\n (2) The blood test of the patients showed normal or decreased white blood cell count (23/29), decreased lymphocyte count (20/29), increased hypersensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) (27/29), and normal procalcitonin.\n In most patients,serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was significantly increased (20/29), while albumin was decreased(15/29).\n Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (Tbil), serum creatinine (Scr) and other items showed no significant changes.\n (3) CT findings of typical cases were single or multiple patchy ground glass shadows accompanied by septal thickening.\n When the disease progresses, the lesion increases and the scope expands, and the ground glass shadow coexists with the solid shadow or the stripe shadow.\n (4) There were statistically significant differences in the expression levels of interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) and IL-6 in the serum of the three groups (P0.05).\n Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia are similar to those of common viral pneumonia.\n High resolution CT is of great value in the differential diagnosis of this disease.\n The increased expression of IL-2R and IL-6 in serum is expected to predict the severity of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia and the prognosis of patients.\n","id":"10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.0005","idformat":"ELASTIC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"

used to diagnose coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), it is undeniable that serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RNAaemia) could be detected in a fraction of COVID-19 patients.\n\n However, it is not clear whether testing for RNAaemia is correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storms or with the specific class of patients.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China.\n\n The patients were divided into three groups according to the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition) issued by the National Health Commission of China.\n\n The clinical and laboratory data were collected.\n\n The serum viral load and IL-6 levels were determined.\n\n .\n\n\nResults\nClinical characteristics analysis of 48 cases of COVID-19 showed that RNAaemia was diagnosed only in the critically ill group and seemed to reflect the severity of the disease.\n\n Furthermore, the level of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in critically ill patients increased significantly, almost 10 times that in other patients.\n\n More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the detection of RNAaemia (R = 0.902).\n\n\nConclusions\nDetectable serum SARS-Cov-2 RNA(RNAaemia) in COVID-19 patients was associated with elevated IL-6 concentration and poor prognosis.\n\n Because the elevated IL-6 may be part of a larger cytokine storm which could worsen outcome, IL-6 could be a potential therapeutic target for critically ill patients with an excessive inflammatory response.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184354","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaohua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

The capacity of several biomarkers, measured at the beginning of hospitalization, to predict mortality was assessed individually.\n\n Those biomarkers that independently contributed to improve mortality prediction were included in a multivariable risk model.\n\n\nResults\nHigh IL-6 level, C-reactive protein level, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, ferritin level, d-dimer level, neutrophil count, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were all predictive of mortality (area under the curve &gt;0.70), as were low albumin level, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, and ratio of peripheral blood oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2).\n\n A multivariable mortality risk model including the SpO2/FiO2 ratio, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, LDH level, IL-6 level, and age was developed and showed high accuracy for the prediction of fatal outcome (area under the curve 0.94).\n\n The optimal cutoff reliably classified patients (including patients with no initial respiratory distress) as survivors and nonsurvivors with 0.88 sensitivity and 0.89 specificity.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis mortality risk model allows early risk stratification of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 before the appearance of obvious signs of clinical deterioration, and it can be used as a tool to guide clinical decision making.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7375283","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rocio","surname":"Laguna-Goya","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Alberto","surname":"Utrero-Rico","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Paloma","surname":"Talayero","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Maria","surname":"Lasa-Lazaro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Angel","surname":"Ramirez-Fernandez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Laura","surname":"Naranjo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Alejandro","surname":"Segura-Tudela","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Oscar","surname":"Cabrera-Marante","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Edgar","surname":"Rodriguez de Frias","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Rocio","surname":"Garcia-Garcia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Mario","surname":"Fernández-Ruiz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Jose Maria","surname":"Aguado","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Joaquin","surname":"Martinez-Lopez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Elena Ana","surname":"Lopez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Mercedes","surname":"Catalan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Antonio","surname":"Serrano","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                           Estela","surname":"Paz-Artal","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/bmj.m1091","date":"2020-03-17","title":"Clinical characteristics of 113 deceased patients with coronavirus disease 2019: retrospective study","abstract":"Objective\nTo delineate the clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) who died.\n\n\nDesign\nRetrospective case series.\n\n\nSetting\nTongji Hospital in Wuhan, China.\n\n\nParticipants\nAmong a cohort of 799 patients, 113 who died and 161 who recovered with a diagnosis of covid-19 were analysed.\n\n Data were collected until 28 February 2020.\nMain outcome measures\nClinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years).\n\n Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83;

disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and portends a poor prognosis.\n\n However, how the dynamics of troponin elevation interplay with inflammation and coagulation biomarkers over time is unknown.\n\n We assessed longitudinal follow-up of cardiac injury, inflammation and coagulation markers in relation to disease severity and outcome.\n\n\nMethods\nWe retrospectively assessed 2068 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between January 29 and April 1, 2020 at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China.\n\n We defined cardiac injury as an increase in high sensitivity cardiac troponin-I (hs-cTnI) above the 99th of the upper reference limit.\n\n We explored the dynamics of elevation in hs-cTnI and the relationship with inflammation (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-2 receptor, tumor necrosis factor-?, C-reactive protein) and coagulation (d-dimer, fibrinogen, international normalized ratio) markers in non-critically ill versus critically ill patients longitudinally and further correlated these markers to survivors and non-survivors.\n\n\nResults\nMedian age was 63 years (first to third quartile 5170 years), 51.4% of whom were women.\n\n When compared to non-critically ill patients (N = 1592, 77.0%), critically ill (defined as requiring mechanical ventilation, in shock or multiorgan failure) patients (N = 476, 23.0%), had more frequent cardiac injury on admission (30.3% vs.\n\n 2.3%, p &lt; 0.001), with increased mortality during hospitalization (38.4% vs.\n\n 0%, p &lt; 0.001).\n\n Among critically ill patients, non-survivors (N = 183) had a continuous increase in hs-cTnI levels during hospitalization, while survivors (N = 293) showed a decrease in hs-cTnI level between day 4 and 7 after admission.\n\n Specifically, cardiac injury is an independent marker of mortality among critically ill patients at admission, day 47 and 814. Consistent positive correlations between hs-cTnI and interleukin (IL)-6 on admission (r = 0.59), day 47 (r = 0.66) and day 814 (r = 0.61; all p &lt; 0.001) and d-dimer (at the same timepoints

injury commonly occurs in critically ill COVID-19 patients, with increased levels of hs-cTnI beyond day 3 since admission portending a poor prognosis.\n\n A consistent positive correlation of hs-cTnI with IL-6 and d-dimer at several timepoints along hospitalization could suggest nonspecific cytokine-mediated cardiotoxicity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7438272","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chenze","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"

Mortality","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic outbreak with a high mortality.\n\n Prognostic factors of critically ill patients with COVID-19 have not been fully elucidated yet.\n\n\nMethods\nIn the present study, 59 patients with COVID-19 from the intensive care unit of the Caidian Branch of Tongji Hospital were enrolled.\n\n Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data, and clinical outcomes were collected.\n\n Prognostic factors were statistically defined.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 59 patients studied (67.4±11.3 years), 38 patients were male, 51 had underlying diseases, and 41 patients died during admission.\n\n Compared with the survivors, the deceased patients were of older age, had more smoking history, severer fatigue, and diarrhea, a higher incidence of multiple organ injuries, more deteriorative lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, remarkably impaired cellular immune response, and strengthened cytokine release.\n\n Age higher than 70 (OR=2.76, 95% CI=1.455.23), arrhythmia (OR=4.76, 95% CI=1.5914.25), and a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score above 4 (OR=5.16, 95% CI=1.2920.55) were identified as risk factors for mortality of patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nCritically ill COVID-19 patients aged higher than 70, arrhythmia, or a SOFA score above 4 have a high risk of mortality, and need prior medical intervention.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7381092","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Zhao-Hua","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

Determinant of Cardiovascular Risk and Poor Prognosis in Coronavirus Disease-19: A Retrospective Case Series Study","abstract":"Background\nAcute myocardial injury and heart failure characterized by elevated cardiac troponin and decreased heart pump function are significant clinical features and prognostic factors of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).\n\n Triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio is an indicator of insulin resistance.\n\n This study aimed to explore the association of the TG/HDL-C ratio with cardiovascular risk and prognosis in COVID-19.\nMethods\nNinety-eight laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital in Wuhan, China, were enrolled in this retrospective study.\n\n Regression models were used to investigate the association between TG/HDL-C ratio with myocardial injury, heart failure, severity, and mortality in COVID-19.\nResults\nAmong the 98 patients, the mean age was 63.9±1.4 years, and male sex (58, 59%) was predominant.\n\n Forty-six patients (47%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), 32 (33%) and 46 (47%) patients suffered from myocardial injury and heart failure, respectively, and 36 (37%) patients died.\n\n The TG/HDL-C ratio was increased in patients with myocardial injury, heart failure, severe illness, and fatal outcome (P&lt;0.05 for each).\n\n Baseline TG/HDL-C ratio significantly correlated with log transformed levels of plasma high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (r=0.251, P=0.018), N-terminal brain natriuretic propeptide (r=0.274, P=0.008), glycated hemoglobin (r=0.239, P=0.038), and interleukin-6 (r=0.218, P=0.042).\n\n Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that an increased TG/HDL-C ratio was independently associated with the risk of myocardial injury [odds ratio (OR)=2.73; P=0.013], heart failure (OR=2.64; P=0.019), disease severity (OR=3.01; P=0.032), and fatal outcome (OR=2.97; P=0.014).\n\n\nConclusion\nIncreased TG/HDL-C ratio was independently associated with myocardial injury, heart failure, disease severity, and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and it may be a useful marker for early identification of patients with high risk and poor outcome.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7591232","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Benping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

admission to the ICU and 48 h before death.\n\n The non-survivors were older (65.46 (s.\n\nd.\n\n 9.74) vs.\n\n 46.45 (s.\n\nd.\n\n 11.09)) and were more likely to have underlying diseases.\n\n The blood group distribution of the COVID-19 cases differed from that of the Han population in Wuhan, with type A being 43.85%; type B, 26.92%; type AB, 10% and type O, 19.23%.\n\n Non-survivors tend to develop more severe lymphopaenia, with higher C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, procalcitonin, D-dimer levels and gradually increased with time.\n\n The clinical manifestations were non-specific.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors more likely to have organ function injury, and to receive mechanical ventilation, either invasively or noninvasively.\n\n Multiple organ failure and secondary bacterial infection in the later period is worthy of attention.\n\n","id":"PMC7487751","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"
